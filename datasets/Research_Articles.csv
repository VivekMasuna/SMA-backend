20973,Closed-form Marginal Likelihood in Gamma-Poisson Matrix Factorization,"  We present novel understandings of the Gamma-Poisson (GaP) model, a
probabilistic matrix factorization model for count data. We show that GaP can
be rewritten free of the score/activation matrix. This gives us new insights
about the estimation of the topic/dictionary matrix by maximum marginal
likelihood estimation. In particular, this explains the robustness of this
estimator to over-specified values of the factorization rank, especially its
ability to automatically prune irrelevant dictionary columns, as empirically
observed in previous work. The marginalization of the activation matrix leads
in turn to a new Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm with favorable
properties.

20974,Laboratory mid-IR spectra of equilibrated and igneous meteorites. Searching for observables of planetesimal debris,"  Meteorites contain minerals from Solar System asteroids with different
properties (like size, presence of water, core formation). We provide new
mid-IR transmission spectra of powdered meteorites to obtain templates of how
mid-IR spectra of asteroidal debris would look like. This is essential for
interpreting mid-IR spectra of past and future space observatories, like the
James Webb Space Telescope. We show that the transmission spectra of wet and
dry chondrites, carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites and achondrite and
chondrite meteorites are distinctly different in a way one can distinguish in
astronomical mid-IR spectra. The two observables that spectroscopically
separate the different meteorites groups (and thus the different types of
parent bodies) are the pyroxene-olivine feature strength ratio and the peak
shift of the olivine spectral features due to an increase in the iron
concentration of the olivine.
"
20975,Case For Static AMSDU Aggregation in WLANs,"  Frame aggregation is a mechanism by which multiple frames are combined into a
single transmission unit over the air. Frames aggregated at the AMSDU level use
a common CRC check to enforce integrity. For longer aggregated AMSDU frames,
the packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate.
Hence, multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based
on the error rate. This study evaluates if there is a \emph{practical}
advantage in doing adaptive AMSDU aggregation based on the link bit error rate.
Evaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive
AMSDU frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation
aspects, it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional
mechanisms while keeping the AMSDU aggregation logic simple.
"
20976,The $Gaia$-ESO Survey: the inner disk intermediate-age open cluster NGC 6802,"  Milky Way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age, chemical
composition, and kinematic properties. Intermediate-age and old open clusters
are less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar
Galactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction
inside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)
observed by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target
for calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and
chemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements
from $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence
dwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as
cluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a
median radial velocity of $13.6\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster
members have a median radial velocity of $12.0\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median
[Fe/H] of $0.10\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster
members suggests an age of $0.9\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and
$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC
6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about
IOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs
previously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and
Berkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.
These elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of
cluster turn-off mass. The $\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements
are also explored in a self-consistent way.
"
20977,Witness-Functions versus Interpretation-Functions for Secrecy in Cryptographic Protocols: What to Choose?,"  Proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task.
One of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is
increasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message
exchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases. Recently, two
families of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of
atomic messages. The first one is the family of interpretation-functions. The
second is the family of witness-functions. In this paper, we show that the
witness-functions are more efficient than interpretation-functions. We give a
detailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed
in proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail
to do so.
"
20978,Pairwise Difference Estimation of High Dimensional Partially Linear Model,"  This paper proposes a regularized pairwise difference approach for estimating
the linear component coefficient in a partially linear model, with consistency
and exact rates of convergence obtained in high dimensions under mild scaling
requirements. Our analysis reveals interesting features such as (i) the
bandwidth parameter automatically adapts to the model and is actually
tuning-insensitive; and (ii) the procedure could even maintain fast rate of
convergence for $\alpha$-Hölder class of $\alpha\leq1/2$. Simulation studies
show the advantage of the proposed method, and application of our approach to a
brain imaging data reveals some biological patterns which fail to be recovered
using competing methods.
"
20979,Dissecting the multivariate extremal index and tail dependence,"  A central issue in the theory of extreme values focuses on suitable
conditions such that the well-known results for the limiting distributions of
the maximum of i.i.d. sequences can be applied to stationary ones. In this
context, the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of
temporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. The
multivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to
a multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the
marginal sequences and between them. As it is a function, the inference becomes
more difficult, and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations,
namely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate. In
this work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of
information contained in the multivariate extremal index, an upper limit better
than those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the
limiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence. We will
illustrate the results with examples of recognized interest in applications.
"
20980,"Big Universe, Big Data: Machine Learning and Image Analysis for Astronomy","  Astrophysics and cosmology are rich with data. The advent of wide-area
digital cameras on large aperture telescopes has led to ever more ambitious
surveys of the sky. Data volumes of entire surveys a decade ago can now be
acquired in a single night and real-time analysis is often desired. Thus,
modern astronomy requires big data know-how, in particular it demands highly
efficient machine learning and image analysis algorithms. But scalability is
not the only challenge: Astronomy applications touch several current machine
learning research questions, such as learning from biased data and dealing with
label and measurement noise. We argue that this makes astronomy a great domain
for computer science research, as it pushes the boundaries of data analysis. In
the following, we will present this exciting application area for data
scientists. We will focus on exemplary results, discuss main challenges, and
highlight some recent methodological advancements in machine learning and image
analysis triggered by astronomical applications.
"
20981,Natural Language Does Not Emerge 'Naturally' in Multi-Agent Dialog,"  A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of
communication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations, and have
simultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in
the protocols developed by the agents, all learned without any human
supervision!
In this paper, using a Task and Tell reference game between two agents as a
testbed, we present a sequence of 'negative' results culminating in a
'positive' one -- showing that while most agent-invented languages are
effective (i.e. achieve near-perfect task rewards), they are decidedly not
interpretable or compositional.
In essence, we find that natural language does not emerge 'naturally',
despite the semblance of ease of natural-language-emergence that one may gather
from recent literature. We discuss how it is possible to coax the invented
languages to become more and more human-like and compositional by increasing
restrictions on how two agents may communicate.
"
20982,Properties and Origin of Galaxy Velocity Bias in the Illustris Simulation,"  We use the hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the Illustris
suite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias, i.e., the
difference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter
inside halos. We find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the
ratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass. In general, central galaxies
are not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos, with a
velocity dispersion above 0.04 times that of the dark matter. The central
galaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions
between the central and satellite galaxies. For satellite galaxies, the
velocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after
being accreted onto the host halos. It depends on the time after the accretion
and their distances from the halo centers, with massive satellites generally
moving more slowly than the dark matter. The results are in broad agreements
with those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering
data, and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy
clustering.
"
20983,Computer Modeling of Halogen Bonds and Other $σ$-Hole Interactions,"  In the field of noncovalent interactions a new paradigm has recently become
popular. It stems from the analysis of molecular electrostatic potentials and
introduces a label, which has recently attracted enormous attention. The label
is {\sigma}-hole, and it was first used in connection with halogens. It
initiated a renaissance of interest in halogenated compounds, and later on,
when found also on other groups of atoms (chalcogens, pnicogens, tetrels and
aerogens), it resulted in a new direction of research of intermolecular
interactions. In this review, we summarize advances from about the last 10
years in understanding those interactions related to {\sigma}-hole. We pay
particular attention to theoretical and computational techniques, which play a
crucial role in the field.
"
20984,Towards Universal End-to-End Affect Recognition from Multilingual Speech by ConvNets,"  We propose an end-to-end affect recognition approach using a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) that handles multiple languages, with applications to
emotion and personality recognition from speech. We lay the foundation of a
universal model that is trained on multiple languages at once. As affect is
shared across all languages, we are able to leverage shared information between
languages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an
average improvement of 12.8% on emotion and 10.1% on personality when compared
with the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we
directly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as
input audio recorded from any source and to avoid the overhead and information
loss of feature extraction. It outperforms a similar CNN using spectrograms as
input by 12.8% for emotion and 6.3% for personality, based on F-scores.
Analysis of the network parameters and layers activation shows that the network
learns and extracts significant features in the first layer, in particular
pitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead
capture language-specific representations through the analysis of
supra-segmental features. Our model represents an important step for the
development of a fully universal affect recognizer, able to recognize
additional descriptors, such as stress, and for the future implementation into
affective interactive systems.
"
20985,A Variational Characterization of Fluid Sloshing with Surface Tension,"  We consider the sloshing problem for an incompressible, inviscid,
irrotational fluid in an open container, including effects due to surface
tension on the free surface. We restrict ourselves to a constant contact angle
and seek time-harmonic solutions of the linearized problem, which describes the
time-evolution of the fluid due to a small initial disturbance of the surface
at rest. As opposed to the zero surface tension case, where the problem reduces
to a partial differential equation for the velocity potential, we obtain a
coupled system for the velocity potential and the free surface displacement. We
derive a new variational formulation of the coupled problem and establish the
existence of solutions using the direct method from the calculus of variations.
We prove a domain monotonicity result for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue.
In the limit of zero surface tension, we recover the variational formulation of
the mixed Steklov-Neumann eigenvalue problem and give the first-order
perturbation formula for a simple eigenvalue.
"
20986,diagnoseIT: Expertengestützte automatische Diagnose von Performance-Probleme in Enterprise-Anwendungen (Abschlussbericht),"  This is the final report of the collaborative research project diagnoseIT on
expert-guided automatic diagnosis of performance problems in enterprise
applications.
"
20987,Statistical Inference in Political Networks Research,"  Researchers interested in statistically modeling network data have a
well-established and quickly growing set of approaches from which to choose.
Several of these methods have been regularly applied in research on political
networks, while others have yet to permeate the field. Here, we review the most
prominent methods of inferential network analysis---both for cross-sectionally
and longitudinally observed networks including (temporal) exponential random
graph models, latent space models, the quadratic assignment procedure, and
stochastic actor oriented models. For each method, we summarize its analytic
form, identify prominent published applications in political science and
discuss computational considerations. We conclude with a set of guidelines for
selecting a method for a given application.
"
20988,Controller-jammer game models of Denial of Service in control systems operating over packet-dropping links,"  The paper introduces a class of zero-sum games between the adversary and
controller as a scenario for a `denial of service' in a networked control
system. The communication link is modeled as a set of transmission regimes
controlled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the
plant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate
that even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point
equilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region
of the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a
nontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard
stochastic control problem over a packet dropping link. The paper derives
conditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium.
Furthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions
provide `greedy' jamming strategies for the adversary.
"
20989,Conservation of spin supercurrents in superconductors,"  We demonstrate that spin supercurrents are conserved upon transmission
through a conventional superconductor, even in the presence of spin-dependent
scattering by impurities with magnetic moments or spin-orbit coupling. This is
fundamentally different from conventional spin currents, which decay in the
presence of such scattering, and this has important implications for the usage
of superconducting materials in spintronic hybrid structures.
"
20990,Driver Identification Using Automobile Sensor Data from a Single Turn,"  As automotive electronics continue to advance, cars are becoming more and
more reliant on sensors to perform everyday driving operations. These sensors
are omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide
comfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers
themselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data
collected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of
individuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where
our dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by
multiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each
individual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short
road segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI
AG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped
with automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show
that turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across
drivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12
most frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway
on-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning
useful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.
"
20991,Same-different problems strain convolutional neural networks,"  The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a
hallmark of biological vision. We argue that, despite recent progress in visual
recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their
ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes
impossible, as when intra-class variability exceeds network capacity. Motivated
by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback
mechanisms including attention and perceptual grouping may be the key
computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\
"
20992,Hyper-dimensional computing for a visual question-answering system that is trainable end-to-end,"  In this work we propose a system for visual question answering. Our
architecture is composed of two parts, the first part creates the logical
knowledge base given the image. The second part evaluates questions against the
knowledge base. Differently from previous work, the knowledge base is
represented using hyper-dimensional computing. This choice has the advantage
that all the operations in the system, namely creating the knowledge base and
evaluating the questions against it, are differentiable, thereby making the
system easily trainable in an end-to-end fashion.
"
20993,The Inner Structure of Time-Dependent Signals,"  This paper shows how a time series of measurements of an evolving system can
be processed to create an inner time series that is unaffected by any
instantaneous invertible, possibly nonlinear transformation of the
measurements. An inner time series contains information that does not depend on
the nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.
Instead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the
observed system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may
produce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence
of sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of
non-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it
consists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series
of an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be
used to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without
using blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.
The method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the
audio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4)
mixtures of audio waveforms of two speakers.
"
20994,Classical properties of the leading eigenstates of quantum dissipative systems,"  By analyzing a paradigmatic example of the theory of dissipative systems --
the classical and quantum dissipative standard map -- we are able to explain
the main features of the decay to the quantum equilibrium state. The classical
isoperiodic stable structures typically present in the parameter space of these
kind of systems play a fundamental role. In fact, we have found that the period
of stable structures that are near in this space determines the phase of the
leading eigenstates of the corresponding quantum superoperator. Moreover, the
eigenvectors show a strong localization on the corresponding periodic orbits
(limit cycles). We show that this sort of scarring phenomenon (an established
property of Hamiltonian and projectively open systems) is present in the
dissipative case and it is of extreme simplicity.
"
20995,Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training,"  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent
structures in sequence modeling. It aims to use gates to control information
flow (e.g., whether to skip some information or not) in the recurrent
computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only
partially achieves this goal. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM
training, which pushes the output values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing
so, we can better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or
closed, instead of in a middle state, which makes the results more
interpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems that we
restrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better or
comparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The
outputs of gates are not sensitive to their inputs: we can easily compress the
LSTM unit in multiple ways, e.g., low-rank approximation and low-precision
approximation. The compressed models are even better than the baseline models
without compression.
"
20996,GUB Covers and Power-Indexed formulations for Wireless Network Design,"  We propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design problem,
i.e. the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service
coverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with classical mixed integer
formulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we
consider only a finite set of powers values. This has two major advantages: it
better fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems
which heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is
an effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the
coverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the GUB cover
inequalities introduced by Wolsey (1990) and its core is an extension of the
exact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints. This
special case corresponds to the very common practical situation where only one
major interferer is present. We assess the effectiveness of our formulation by
comprehensive computational results over realistic instances of two typical
technologies, namely WiMAX and DVB-T.
"
20997,Orbital contributions to the electron g-factor in semiconductor nanowires,"  Recent experiments on Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires [Albrecht
et al., Nat. 531, 206 (2016)] revealed a surprisingly large electronic Landé
g-factor, several times larger than the bulk value - contrary to the
expectation that confinement reduces the g-factor. Here we assess the role of
orbital contributions to the electron g-factor in nanowires and quantum dots.
We show that an LS coupling in higher subbands leads to an enhancement of the
g-factor of an order of magnitude or more for small effective mass
semiconductors. We validate our theoretical finding with simulations of InAs
and InSb, showing that the effect persists even if cylindrical symmetry is
broken. A huge anisotropy of the enhanced g-factors under magnetic field
rotation allows for a straightforward experimental test of this theory.
"
20998,Comprehensive routing strategy on multilayer networks,"  Designing an efficient routing strategy is of great importance to alleviate
traffic congestion in multilayer networks. In this work, we design an effective
routing strategy for multilayer networks by comprehensively considering the
roles of nodes' local structures in micro-level, as well as the macro-level
differences in transmission speeds between different layers. Both numerical and
analytical results indicate that our proposed routing strategy can reasonably
redistribute the traffic load of the low speed layer to the high speed layer,
and thus the traffic capacity of multilayer networks are significantly enhanced
compared with the monolayer low speed networks. There is an optimal combination
of macro- and micro-level control parameters at which can remarkably alleviate
the congestion and thus maximize the traffic capacity for a given multilayer
network. Moreover, we find that increasing the size and the average degree of
the high speed layer can enhance the traffic capacity of multilayer networks
more effectively. We finally verify that real-world network topology does not
invalidate the results. The theoretical predictions agree well with the
numerical simulations.
"
20999,Long short-term memory and learning-to-learn in networks of spiking neurons,"  Recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) underlie the astounding
computing and learning capabilities of the brain. But computing and learning
capabilities of RSNN models have remained poor, at least in comparison with
artificial neural networks (ANNs). We address two possible reasons for that.
One is that RSNNs in the brain are not randomly connected or designed according
to simple rules, and they do not start learning as a tabula rasa network.
Rather, RSNNs in the brain were optimized for their tasks through evolution,
development, and prior experience. Details of these optimization processes are
largely unknown. But their functional contribution can be approximated through
powerful optimization methods, such as backpropagation through time (BPTT).
A second major mismatch between RSNNs in the brain and models is that the
latter only show a small fraction of the dynamics of neurons and synapses in
the brain. We include neurons in our RSNN model that reproduce one prominent
dynamical process of biological neurons that takes place at the behaviourally
relevant time scale of seconds: neuronal adaptation. We denote these networks
as LSNNs because of their Long short-term memory. The inclusion of adapting
neurons drastically increases the computing and learning capability of RSNNs if
they are trained and configured by deep learning (BPTT combined with a rewiring
algorithm that optimizes the network architecture). In fact, the computational
performance of these RSNNs approaches for the first time that of LSTM networks.
In addition RSNNs with adapting neurons can acquire abstract knowledge from
prior learning in a Learning-to-Learn (L2L) scheme, and transfer that knowledge
in order to learn new but related tasks from very few examples. We demonstrate
this for supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
"
21000,Detecting Molecular Rotational Dynamics Complementing the Low-Frequency Terahertz Vibrations in a Zirconium-Based Metal-Organic Framework,"  We show clear experimental evidence of co-operative terahertz (THz) dynamics
observed below 3 THz (~100 cm-1), for a low-symmetry Zr-based metal-organic
framework (MOF) structure, termed MIL-140A [ZrO(O2C-C6H4-CO2)]. Utilizing a
combination of high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and synchrotron
radiation far-infrared spectroscopy, we measured low-energy vibrations
originating from the hindered rotations of organic linkers, whose energy
barriers and detailed dynamics have been elucidated via ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. For completeness, we obtained Raman
spectra and characterized the alterations to the complex pore architecture
caused by the THz rotations. We discovered an array of soft modes with
trampoline-like motions, which could potentially be the source of anomalous
mechanical phenomena, such as negative linear compressibility and negative
thermal expansion. Our results also demonstrate coordinated shear dynamics
(~2.5 THz), a mechanism which we have shown to destabilize MOF crystals, in the
exact crystallographic direction of the minimum shear modulus (Gmin).
"
21001,A southern-sky total intensity source catalogue at 2.3 GHz from S-band Polarisation All-Sky Survey data,"  The S-band Polarisation All-Sky Survey (S-PASS) has observed the entire
southern sky using the 64-metre Parkes radio telescope at 2.3GHz with an
effective bandwidth of 184MHz. The surveyed sky area covers all declinations
$\delta\leq 0^\circ$. To analyse compact sources the survey data have been
re-processed to produce a set of 107 Stokes $I$ maps with 10.75arcmin
resolution and the large scale emission contribution filtered out. In this
paper we use these Stokes $I$ images to create a total intensity southern-sky
extragalactic source catalogue at 2.3GHz. The source catalogue contains 23,389
sources and covers a sky area of 16,600deg$^2$, excluding the Galactic plane
for latitudes $|b|<10^\circ$. Approximately 8% of catalogued sources are
resolved. S-PASS source positions are typically accurate to within 35arcsec. At
a flux density of 225mJy the S-PASS source catalogue is more than 95% complete,
and $\sim$94% of S-PASS sources brighter than 500mJy beam$^{-1}$ have a
counterpart at lower frequencies.
"
21002,Mechanomyography based closed-loop Functional Electrical Stimulation cycling system,"  Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems are successful in restoring
motor function and supporting paralyzed users. Commercially available FES
products are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing
conditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and
poor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop
between stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive
stimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to
monitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography
(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel
mechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during
stimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling
rig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and
stimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the
pedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a
magnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a
potentiometer. We illustrated this with a closed-loop stimulation algorithm
that used the inputs from the sensors to control the output of a programmable
RehaStim 1 FES stimulator (Hasomed) in real-time. This recumbent bicycle rig
was used as a testing platform for FES cycling. The algorithm was designed to
respond to a change in requested speed (RPM) from the user and change the
stimulation power (% of maximum current mA) until this speed was achieved and
then maintain it.
"
21003,QT2S: A System for Monitoring Road Traffic via Fine Grounding of Tweets,"  Social media platforms provide continuous access to user generated content
that enables real-time monitoring of user behavior and of events. The
geographical dimension of such user behavior and events has recently caught a
lot of attention in several domains: mobility, humanitarian, or
infrastructural. While resolving the location of a user can be straightforward,
depending on the affordances of their device and/or of the application they are
using, in most cases, locating a user demands a larger effort, such as
exploiting textual features. On Twitter for instance, only 2% of all tweets are
geo-referenced. In this paper, we present a system for zoomed-in grounding
(below city level) for short messages (e.g., tweets). The system combines
different natural language processing and machine learning techniques to
increase the number of geo-grounded tweets, which is essential to many
applications such as disaster response and real-time traffic monitoring.
"
21004,A Benchmark for Dose Finding Studies with Continuous Outcomes,"  An important tool to evaluate the performance of any design is an optimal
benchmark proposed by O'Quigley and others (2002, Biostatistics 3(1), 51-56)
that provides an upper bound on the performance of a design under a given
scenario. The original benchmark can be applied to dose finding studies with a
binary endpoint only. However, there is a growing interest in dose finding
studies involving continuous outcomes, but no benchmark for such studies has
been developed. We show that the original benchmark and its extension by Cheung
(2014, Biometrics 70(2), 389-397), when looked at from a different perspective,
can be generalised to various settings with several discrete and continuous
outcomes. We illustrate and compare the benchmark performance in the setting of
a Phase I clinical trial with continuous toxicity endpoint and in the setting
of a Phase I/II clinical trial with continuous efficacy outcome. We show that
the proposed benchmark provides an accurate upper bound for model-based dose
finding methods and serves as a powerful tool for evaluating designs.
"
21005,Wavefront retrieval through random pupil plane phase probes: Gerchberg-Saxton approach,"  A pupil plane wavefront reconstruction procedure is proposed based on
analysis of a sequence of focal plane images corresponding to a sequence of
random pupil plane phase probes. The developed method provides the unique
nontrivial solution of wavefront retrieval problem and shows global convergence
to this solution demonstrated using a Gerchberg-Saxton implementation. The
method is general and can be used in any optical system that includes
deformable mirrors for active/adaptive wavefront correction. The presented
numerical simulation and lab experimental results show low noise sensitivity,
high reliability and robustness of the proposed approach for high quality
optical wavefront restoration. Laboratory experiments have shown $\lambda$/14
rms accuracy in retrieval of a poked DM actuator fiducial pattern with spatial
resolution of 20-30$~\mu$m that is comparable with accuracy of direct
high-resolution interferometric measurements.
"
21006,Uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for 5G Wireless Networks,"  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) as well as other
orthogonal multiple access techniques fail to achieve the system capacity limit
in the uplink due to the exclusivity in resource allocation. This issue is more
prominent when fairness among the users is considered in the system. Current
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques introduce redundancy by
coding/spreading to facilitate the users' signals separation at the receiver,
which degrade the system spectral efficiency. Hence, in order to achieve higher
capacity, more efficient NOMA schemes need to be developed. In this paper, we
propose a NOMA scheme for uplink that removes the resource allocation
exclusivity and allows more than one user to share the same subcarrier without
any coding/spreading redundancy. Joint processing is implemented at the
receiver to detect the users' signals. However, to control the receiver
complexity, an upper limit on the number of users per subcarrier needs to be
imposed. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is
proposed for the new NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' sum-rate. The
link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed scheme achieves
bit error rate close to the single-user case. Numerical results show that the
proposed NOMA scheme can significantly improve the system performance in terms
of spectral efficiency and fairness comparing to OFDMA.

21007,Epsilon-approximations and epsilon-nets,"  The use of random samples to approximate properties of geometric
configurations has been an influential idea for both combinatorial and
algorithmic purposes. This chapter considers two related
notions---$\epsilon$-approximations and $\epsilon$-nets---that capture the most
important quantitative properties that one would expect from a random sample
with respect to an underlying geometric configuration.
"
21008,A continuous framework for fairness,"  Increasingly, discrimination by algorithms is perceived as a societal and
legal problem. As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic
fairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper
proposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\theta$) which enables a
continuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More
specifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.
First, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between
concepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the algorithm
enables the decision maker to adopt intermediate ""worldviews"" on the degree of
discrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to the extreme
cases of ""we're all equal"" (WAE) and ""what you see is what you get"" (WYSIWYG)
proposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal transport theory, and
specifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize decision maker utility
under the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the algorithm is able to handle
cases of intersectionality, i.e., of multi-dimensional discrimination of
certain groups on grounds of several criteria. We discuss three main examples
(college admissions; credit application; insurance contracts) and map out the
policy implications of our approach. The explicit formalization of the
trade-off between individual and group fairness allows this post-processing
approach to be tailored to different situational contexts in which one or the
other fairness criterion may take precedence.
"
21009,Counting Subwords Occurrences in Base-b Expansions,"  We count the number of distinct (scattered) subwords occurring in the base-b
expansion of the non-negative integers. More precisely, we consider the
sequence $(S_b(n))_{n\ge 0}$ counting the number of positive entries on each
row of a generalization of the Pascal triangle to binomial coefficients of
base-$b$ expansions. By using a convenient tree structure, we provide
recurrence relations for $(S_b(n))_{n\ge 0}$ leading to the $b$-regularity of
the latter sequence. Then we deduce the asymptotics of the summatory function
of the sequence $(S_b(n))_{n\ge 0}$.
"
21010,Tensor Renormalization Group with Randomized Singular Value Decomposition,"  An algorithm of the tensor renormalization group is proposed based on a
randomized algorithm for singular value decomposition. Our algorithm is
applicable to a broad range of two-dimensional classical models. In the case of
a square lattice, its computational complexity and memory usage are
proportional to the fifth and the third power of the bond dimension,
respectively, whereas those of the conventional implementation are of the sixth
and the fourth power. The oversampling parameter larger than the bond dimension
is sufficient to reproduce the same result as full singular value decomposition
even at the critical point of the two-dimensional Ising model.
"
21011,Cohomology of symplectic groups and Meyer's signature theorem,"  Meyer showed that the signature of a closed oriented surface bundle over a
surface is a multiple of $4$, and can be computed using an element of
$H^2(\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z})$. Denoting by $1 \to \mathbb{Z}
\to \widetilde{\mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})} \to \mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z}) \to
1$ the pullback of the universal cover of $\mathsf{ Sp}(2g,\mathbb{R})$,
Deligne proved that every finite index subgroup of $\widetilde{\mathsf {Sp}(2g,
\mathbb{Z})}$ contains $2\mathbb{Z}$. As a consequence, a class in the second
cohomology of any finite quotient of $\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z})$ can at most
enable us to compute the signature of a surface bundle modulo $8$. We show that
this is in fact possible and investigate the smallest quotient of
$\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z})$ that contains this information. This quotient
$\mathfrak{H}$ is a non-split extension of $\mathsf {Sp}(2g,2)$ by an
elementary abelian group of order $2^{2g+1}$. There is a central extension
$1\to \mathbb{Z}/2\to\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}\to\mathfrak{H}\to 1$, and
$\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ appears as a quotient of the metaplectic double cover
$\mathsf{Mp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})=\widetilde{\mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
It is an extension of $\mathsf{Sp}(2g,2)$ by an almost extraspecial group of
order $2^{2g+2}$, and has a faithful irreducible complex representation of
dimension $2^g$. Provided $g\ge 4$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ is the universal
central extension of $\mathfrak{H}$. Putting all this together, we provide a
recipe for computing the signature modulo $8$, and indicate some consequences.
"
21012,The Newman--Shapiro problem,"  We give a negative answer to the Newman--Shapiro problem on weighted
approximation for entire functions formulated in 1966 and motivated by the
theory of operators on the Fock space. There exists a function in the Fock
space such that its exponential multiples do not approximate some entire
multiples in the space. Furthermore, we establish several positive results
under different restrictions on the function in question.
"
21013,randUTV: A blocked randomized algorithm for computing a rank-revealing UTV factorization,"  This manuscript describes the randomized algorithm randUTV for computing a so
called UTV factorization efficiently. Given a matrix $A$, the algorithm
computes a factorization $A = UTV^{*}$, where $U$ and $V$ have orthonormal
columns, and $T$ is triangular (either upper or lower, whichever is preferred).
The algorithm randUTV is developed primarily to be a fast and easily
parallelized alternative to algorithms for computing the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). randUTV provides accuracy very close to that of the SVD
for problems such as low-rank approximation, solving ill-conditioned linear
systems, determining bases for various subspaces associated with the matrix,
etc. Moreover, randUTV produces highly accurate approximations to the singular
values of $A$. Unlike the SVD, the randomized algorithm proposed builds a UTV
factorization in an incremental, single-stage, and non-iterative way, making it
possible to halt the factorization process once a specified tolerance has been
met. Numerical experiments comparing the accuracy and speed of randUTV to the
SVD are presented. These experiments demonstrate that in comparison to column
pivoted QR, which is another factorization that is often used as a relatively
economic alternative to the SVD, randUTV compares favorably in terms of speed
while providing far higher accuracy.

21014,"Continuity of nonlinear eigenvalues in $CD(K,\infty)$ spaces with respect to measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence","  In this note we prove in the nonlinear setting of $CD(K,\infty)$ spaces the
stability of the Krasnoselskii spectrum of the Laplace operator $-\Delta$ under
measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, under an additional compactness
assumption satisfied, for instance, by sequences of $CD^*(K,N)$ metric measure
spaces with uniformly bounded diameter. Additionally, we show that every
element $\lambda$ in the Krasnoselskii spectrum is indeed an eigenvalue, namely
there exists a nontrivial $u$ satisfying the eigenvalue equation $- \Delta u =
\lambda u$.
"
21015,Modeling WiFi Traffic for White Space Prediction in Wireless Sensor Networks,"  Cross Technology Interference (CTI) is a prevalent phenomenon in the 2.4 GHz
unlicensed spectrum causing packet losses and increased channel contention. In
particular, WiFi interference is a severe problem for low-power wireless
networks as its presence causes a significant degradation of the overall
performance. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach based on WiFi
interference modeling for accurately predicting transmission opportunities for
low-power wireless networks. We leverage statistical analysis of real-world
WiFi traces to learn aggregated traffic characteristics in terms of
Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) that, once captured into a specific 2nd order Markov
Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP(2)) model, enable accurate estimation of
interference. We further use a hidden Markov model (HMM) for channel occupancy
prediction. We evaluated the performance of i) the MMPP(2) traffic model w.r.t.
real-world traces and an existing Pareto model for accurately characterizing
the WiFi traffic and, ii) compared the HMM based white space prediction to
random channel access. We report encouraging results for using interference
modeling for white space prediction.
"
21016,Dyson models under renormalization and in weak fields,"  We consider one-dimensional long-range spin models (usually called Dyson
models), consisting of Ising ferromagnets with slowly decaying long-range pair
potentials of the form $\frac{1}{|i-j|^{\alpha}}$ mainly focusing on the range
of slow decays $1 < \alpha \leq 2$. We describe two recent results, one about
renormalization and one about the effect of external fields at low temperature.
The first result states that a decimated long-range Gibbs measure in one
dimension becomes non-Gibbsian, in the same vein as comparable results in
higher dimensions for short-range models. The second result addresses the
behaviour of such models under inhomogeneous fields, in particular external
fields which decay to zero polynomially as $(|i|+1)^{- \gamma}$. We study how
the critical decay power of the field, $\gamma$, for which the phase transition
persists and the decay power $\alpha$ of the Dyson model compare, extending
recent results for short-range models on lattices and on trees. We also briefly
point out some analogies between these results.
"
21017,Coupling geometry on binary bipartite networks: hypotheses testing on pattern geometry and nestedness,"  Upon a matrix representation of a binary bipartite network, via the
permutation invariance, a coupling geometry is computed to approximate the
minimum energy macrostate of a network's system. Such a macrostate is supposed
to constitute the intrinsic structures of the system, so that the coupling
geometry should be taken as information contents, or even the nonparametric
minimum sufficient statistics of the network data. Then pertinent null and
alternative hypotheses, such as nestedness, are to be formulated according to
the macrostate. That is, any efficient testing statistic needs to be a function
of this coupling geometry. These conceptual architectures and mechanisms are by
and large still missing in community ecology literature, and rendered
misconceptions prevalent in this research area. Here the algorithmically
computed coupling geometry is shown consisting of deterministic multiscale
block patterns, which are framed by two marginal ultrametric trees on row and
column axes, and stochastic uniform randomness within each block found on the
finest scale. Functionally a series of increasingly larger ensembles of matrix
mimicries is derived by conforming to the multiscale block configurations. Here
matrix mimicking is meant to be subject to constraints of row and column sums
sequences. Based on such a series of ensembles, a profile of distributions
becomes a natural device for checking the validity of testing statistics or
structural indexes. An energy based index is used for testing whether network
data indeed contains structural geometry. A new version block-based nestedness
index is also proposed. Its validity is checked and compared with the existing
ones. A computing paradigm, called Data Mechanics, and its application on one
real data network are illustrated throughout the developments and discussions
in this paper.
"
21018,"MUSE-inspired view of the quasar Q2059-360, its Lyman alpha blob, and its neighborhood","  The radio-quiet quasar Q2059-360 at redshift $z=3.08$ is known to be close to
a small Lyman $\alpha$ blob (LAB) and to be absorbed by a proximate damped
Ly$\alpha$ (PDLA) system.
Here, we present the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field
spectroscopy follow-up of this quasi-stellar object (QSO). Our primary goal is
to characterize this LAB in detail by mapping it both spatially and spectrally
using the Ly$\alpha$ line, and by looking for high-ionization lines to
constrain the emission mechanism.
Combining the high sensitivity of the MUSE integral field spectrograph
mounted on the Yepun telescope at ESO-VLT with the natural coronagraph provided
by the PDLA, we map the LAB down to the QSO position, after robust subtraction
of QSO light in the spectral domain.
In addition to confirming earlier results for the small bright component of
the LAB, we unveil a faint filamentary emission protruding to the south over
about 80 pkpc (physical kpc); this results in a total size of about 120 pkpc.
We derive the velocity field of the LAB (assuming no transfer effects) and map
the Ly$\alpha$ line width. Upper limits are set to the flux of the N V $\lambda
1238-1242$, C IV $\lambda 1548-1551$, He II $\lambda 1640$, and C III] $\lambda
1548-1551$ lines. We have discovered two probable Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the
same redshift as the LAB and at projected distances of 265 kpc and 207 kpc from
the QSO; their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities might well be enhanced by the QSO
radiation. We also find an emission line galaxy at $z=0.33$ near the line of
sight to the QSO.
This LAB shares the same general characteristics as the 17 others surrounding
radio-quiet QSOs presented previously. However, there are indications that it
may be centered on the PDLA galaxy rather than on the QSO.
"
21019,Community Detection on Euclidean Random Graphs,"  We study the problem of community detection (CD) on Euclidean random
geometric graphs where each vertex has two latent variables: a binary community
label and a $\mathbb{R}^d$ valued location label which forms the support of a
Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda$. A random graph is then drawn with
edge probabilities dependent on both the community and location labels. In
contrast to the stochastic block model (SBM) that has no location labels, the
resulting random graph contains many more short loops due to the geometric
embedding. We consider the recovery of the community labels, partial and exact,
using the random graph and the location labels. We establish phase transitions
for both sparse and logarithmic degree regimes, and provide bounds on the
location of the thresholds, conjectured to be tight in the case of exact
recovery. We also show that the threshold of the distinguishability problem,
i.e., the testing between our model and the null model without community labels
exhibits no phase-transition and in particular, does not match the weak
recovery threshold (in contrast to the SBM).
"
21020,Load balancing with heterogeneous schedulers,"  Load balancing is a common approach in web server farms or inventory routing
problems. An important issue in such systems is to determine the server to
which an incoming request should be routed to optimize a given performance
criteria. In this paper, we assume the server's scheduling disciplines to be
heterogeneous. More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline
which belongs to the class of limited processor sharing (LPS-$d$) scheduling
disciplines. Under LPS-$d$, up to $d$ jobs can be served simultaneously, and
hence, includes as special cases First Come First Served ($d=1$) and Processor
Sharing ($d=\infty$).
In order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model the above load-balancing
framework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem. Using the relaxation
technique, as first developed in the seminal work of Whittle, we derive
Whittle's index policy for general cost functions and obtain a closed-form
expression for Whittle's index in terms of the steady-state distribution.
Through numerical computations, we investigate the performance of Whittle's
index with two different performance criteria: linear cost criterion and a cost
criterion that depends on the first and second moment of the throughput. Our
results show that \emph{(i)} the structure of Whittle's index policy can
strongly depend on the scheduling discipline implemented in the server, i.e.,
on $d$, and that \emph{(ii)} Whittle's index policy significantly outperforms
standard dispatching rules such as Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), Join the
Shortest Expected Workload (JSEW), and Random Server allocation (RSA).
"
21021,An Information Theoretic Framework for Active De-anonymization in Social Networks Based on Group Memberships,"  In this paper, a new mathematical formulation for the problem of
de-anonymizing social network users by actively querying their membership in
social network groups is introduced. In this formulation, the attacker has
access to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the
social network. When an unidentified victim visits a malicious website, the
attacker uses browser history sniffing to make queries regarding the victim's
social media activity. Particularly, it can make polar queries regarding the
victim's group memberships and the victim's identity. The attacker receives
noisy responses to her queries. The goal is to de-anonymize the victim with the
minimum number of queries. Starting with a rigorous mathematical model for this
active de-anonymization problem, an upper bound on the attacker's expected
query cost is derived, and new attack algorithms are proposed which achieve
this bound. These algorithms vary in computational cost and performance. The
results suggest that prior heuristic approaches to this problem provide
sub-optimal solutions.
"
21022,Geobiodynamics and Roegenian Economic Systems,"  This mathematical essay brings together ideas from Economics, Geobiodynamics
and Thermodynamics. Its purpose is to obtain real models of complex
evolutionary systems. More specifically, the essay defines Roegenian Economy
and links Geobiodynamics and Roegenian Economy. In this context, we discuss the
isomorphism between the concepts and techniques of Thermodynamics and
Economics. Then we describe a Roegenian economic system like a Carnot group.
After we analyse the phase equilibrium for two heterogeneous economic systems.
The European Union Economics appears like Cartesian product of Roegenian
economic systems and its Balance is analysed in details. A Section at the end
describes the ""economic black holes"" as small parts of a a global economic
system in which national income is so great that it causes others poor
enrichment. These ideas can be used to improve our knowledge and understanding
of the nature of development and evolution of thermodynamic-economic systems.
"
21023,The effects of the overshooting of the convective core on main-sequence turnoffs of young- and intermediate-age star clusters,"  Recent investigations have shown that the extended main-sequence turnoffs
(eMSTOs) are a common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds. The eMSTOs are also found in the color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) of young-age star clusters. The origin of the eMSTOs is still an open
question. Moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting
parameter $\delta_{\rm ov}$ of the convective core is not fixed for the stars
with an approximatelly equal mass. Thus the MSTO of star clusters may be
affected by the overshooting of the convective core (OVCC). We calculated the
effects of the OVCC with different $\delta_{\rm ov}$ on the MSTO of young- and
intermediate-age star clusters. \textbf{If $\delta_{\rm ov}$ varies between
stars in a cluster,} the observed eMSTOs of young- and intermediate-age star
clusters can be explained well by the effects. The equivalent age spreads of
MSTO caused by the OVCC are related to the age of star clusters and are in good
agreement with observed results of many clusters. Moreover, the observed eMSTOs
of NGC 1856 are reproduced by the coeval populations with different
$\delta_{\rm ov}$. The eMSTOs of star clusters may be relevant to the effects
of the OVCC. The effects of the OVCC \textbf{are similar to that of rotation in
some respects. But the effects cannot result in a significant split of main
sequence of young star clusters at $m_{U}\lesssim 21$.} The presence of a rapid
rotation can make the split of main sequence of young star clusters more
significant.
"
21024,First eigenvalue estimates of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators on graphs,"  Following Escobar [Esc97] and Jammes [Jam15], we introduce two types of
isoperimetric constants and give lower bound estimates for the first nontrivial
eigenvalues of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators on finite graphs with boundary
respectively.
"
21025,Air-burst Generated Tsunamis,"  This paper examines the questions of whether smaller asteroids that burst in
the air over water can generate tsunamis that could pose a threat to distant
locations. Such air burst-generated tsunamis are qualitatively different than
the more frequently studied earthquake-generated tsunamis, and differ as well
from impact asteroids. Numerical simulations are presented using the shallow
water equations in several settings, demonstrating very little tsunami threat
from this scenario. A model problem with an explicit solution that demonstrates
and explains the same phenomena found in the computations is analyzed. We
discuss the question of whether compressibility and dispersion are important
effects that should be included, and show results from a more sophisticated
model problem using the linearized Euler equations that begins to addresses
this.
"
21026,A new design principle of robust onion-like networks self-organized in growth,"  Today's economy, production activity, and our life are sustained by social
and technological network infrastructures, while new threats of network attacks
by destructing loops have been found recently in network science. We inversely
take into account the weakness, and propose a new design principle for
incrementally growing robust networks. The networks are self-organized by
enhancing interwoven long loops. In particular, we consider the range-limited
approximation of linking by intermediations in a few hops, and show the strong
robustness in the growth without degrading efficiency of paths. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the tolerance of connectivity is reformable even from
extremely vulnerable real networks according to our proposed growing process
with some investment. These results may indicate a prospective direction to the
future growth of our network infrastructures.
"
21027,Surrogate Losses for Online Learning of Stepsizes in Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization,"  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has played a central role in machine
learning. However, it requires a carefully hand-picked stepsize for fast
convergence, which is notoriously tedious and time-consuming to tune. Over the
last several years, a plethora of adaptive gradient-based algorithms have
emerged to ameliorate this problem. They have proved efficient in reducing the
labor of tuning in practice, but many of them lack theoretic guarantees even in
the convex setting. In this paper, we propose new surrogate losses to cast the
problem of learning the optimal stepsizes for the stochastic optimization of a
non-convex smooth objective function onto an online convex optimization
problem. This allows the use of no-regret online algorithms to compute optimal
stepsizes on the fly. In turn, this results in a SGD algorithm with self-tuned
stepsizes that guarantees convergence rates that are automatically adaptive to
the level of noise.
"
21028,On Categorical Time Series Models With Covariates,"  We study the problem of stationarity and ergodicity for autoregressive
multinomial logistic time series models which possibly include a latent process
and are defined by a GARCH-type recursive equation. We improve considerably
upon the existing results related to stationarity and ergodicity conditions of
such models. Proofs are based on theory developed for chains with complete
connections. This approach is based on a useful coupling technique which is
utilized for studying ergodicity of more general finite-state stochastic
processes. Such processes generalize finite-state Markov chains by assuming
infinite order models of past values. For finite order Markov chains, we also
discuss ergodicity properties when some strongly exogenous covariates are
considered in the dynamics of the process.
"
21029,Layered Coding for Energy Harvesting Communication Without CSIT,"  Due to stringent constraints on resources, it may be infeasible to acquire
the current channel state information at the transmitter in energy harvesting
communication systems. In this paper, we optimize an energy harvesting
transmitter, communicating over a slow fading channel, using layered coding.
The transmitter has access to the channel statistics, but does not know the
exact channel state. In layered coding, the codewords are first designed for
each of the channel states at different rates, and then the codewords are
either time-multiplexed or superimposed before the transmission, leading to two
transmission strategies. The receiver then decodes the information adaptively
based on the realized channel state. The transmitter is equipped with a
finite-capacity battery having non-zero internal resistance. In each of the
transmission strategies, we first formulate and study an average rate
maximization problem with non-causal knowledge of the harvested power
variations. Further, assuming statistical knowledge and causal information of
the harvested power variations, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm, and compare
with the stochastic dynamic programming based solution and a greedy policy.
"
21030,The automorphisms of Petit's algebras,"  Let $\sigma$ be an automorphism of a field $K$ with fixed field $F$. We study
the automorphisms of nonassociative unital algebras which are canonical
generalizations of the associative quotient algebras $K[t;\sigma]/fK[t;\sigma]$
obtained when the twisted polynomial $f\in K[t;\sigma]$ is invariant, and were
first defined by Petit. We compute all their automorphisms if $\sigma$ commutes
with all automorphisms in ${\rm Aut}_F(K)$ and $n\geq m-1$, where $n$ is the
order of $\sigma$ and $m$ the degree of $f$,and obtain partial results for
$n<m-1$. In the case where $K/F$ is a finite Galois field extension, we obtain
more detailed information on the structure of the automorphism groups of these
nonassociative unital algebras over $F$. We also briefly investigate when two
such algebras are isomorphic.
"
21031,A convolutional autoencoder approach for mining features in cellular electron cryo-tomograms and weakly supervised coarse segmentation,"  Cellular electron cryo-tomography enables the 3D visualization of cellular
organization in the near-native state and at submolecular resolution. However,
the contents of cellular tomograms are often complex, making it difficult to
automatically isolate different in situ cellular components. In this paper, we
propose a convolutional autoencoder-based unsupervised approach to provide a
coarse grouping of 3D small subvolumes extracted from tomograms. We demonstrate
that the autoencoder can be used for efficient and coarse characterization of
features of macromolecular complexes and surfaces, such as membranes. In
addition, the autoencoder can be used to detect non-cellular features related
to sample preparation and data collection, such as carbon edges from the grid
and tomogram boundaries. The autoencoder is also able to detect patterns that
may indicate spatial interactions between cellular components. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our autoencoder can be used for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation of cellular components, requiring a very small amount of manual
annotation.
"
21032,Probabilistic Rule Realization and Selection,"  Abstraction and realization are bilateral processes that are key in deriving
intelligence and creativity. In many domains, the two processes are approached
through rules: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet
diverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces, we
focus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample
distributions that follow the given rules. More ambitiously, we go beyond a
mechanical realization that takes whatever is given, but instead ask for
proactively selecting reasonable rules to realize. This goal is demanding in
practice, since the initial rule set may not always be consistent and thus
intelligent compromises are needed. We formulate both rule realization and
selection as two strongly connected components within a single and symmetric
bi-convex problem, and derive an efficient algorithm that works at large scale.
Taking music compositional rules as the main example throughout the paper, we
demonstrate our model's efficiency in not only music realization (composition)
but also music interpretation and understanding (analysis).
"
21033,Asymptotic and numerical analysis of a porous medium model for transpiration-driven sap flow in trees,"  We develop a 3D porous medium model for sap flow within a tree stem, which
consists of a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation with a suitable
transpiration source term. Using an asymptotic analysis, we derive approximate
series solutions for the liquid saturation and sap velocity for a general class
of coefficient functions. Several important non-dimensional parameters are
identified that can be used to characterize various flow regimes. We
investigate the relative importance of stem aspect ratio versus anisotropy in
the sapwood hydraulic conductivity, and how these two effects impact the radial
and vertical components of sap velocity. The analytical results are validated
by means of a second-order finite volume discretization of the governing
equations, and comparisons are drawn to experimental results on Norway spruce
trees.
"
21034,Risk Estimators for Choosing Regularization Parameters in Ill-Posed Problems - Properties and Limitations,"  This paper discusses the properties of certain risk estimators recently
proposed to choose regularization parameters in ill-posed problems. A simple
approach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in
the data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the
space of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more
appropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do
not tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical
studies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite
dimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also
leads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends
to infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with
a very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the
risk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical
results indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate
asymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed
numerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads
to extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize
the reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness
also appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather
conservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization
parameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure
for ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization
demonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational
regularization approaches.
"
21035,Analyzing Effects of Seasonal Variations in Wind Generation and Load on Voltage Profiles,"  This paper presents a methodology for building daily profiles of wind
generation and load for different seasons to assess their impacts on voltage
violations. The measurement-based wind models showed very high accuracy when
validated against several years of actual wind power data. System load modeling
was carried out by analyzing the seasonal trends that occur in residential,
commercial, and industrial loads. When the proposed approach was implemented on
the IEEE 118-bus system, it could identify violations in bus voltage profiles
that the season-independent model could not capture. The results of the
proposed approach are expected to provide better visualization of the problems
that seasonal variations in wind power and load might cause to the electric
power grid.
"
21036,Imitation Learning from Imperfect Demonstration,"  Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn an optimal policy from demonstrations.
However, such demonstrations are often imperfect since collecting optimal ones
is costly. To effectively learn from imperfect demonstrations, we propose a
novel approach that utilizes confidence scores, which describe the quality of
demonstrations. More specifically, we propose two confidence-based IL methods,
namely two-step importance weighting IL (2IWIL) and generative adversarial IL
with imperfect demonstration and confidence (IC-GAIL). We show that confidence
scores given only to a small portion of sub-optimal demonstrations
significantly improve the performance of IL both theoretically and empirically.
"
21037,Some Bounds on Binary LCD Codes,"  A linear code with a complementary dual (or LCD code) is defined to be a
linear code $C$ whose dual code $C^{\perp}$ satisfies $C \cap C^{\perp}$=
$\left\{ \mathbf{0}\right\} $. Let $LCD{[}n,k{]}$ denote the maximum of
possible values of $d$ among $[n,k,d]$ binary LCD codes. We give exact values
of $LCD{[}n,k{]}$ for $1 \le k \le n \le 12$.
We also show that $LCD[n,n-i]=2$ for any $i\geq2$ and $n\geq2^{i}$.
Furthermore, we show that $LCD[n,k]\leq LCD[n,k-1]$ for $k$ odd and
$LCD[n,k]\leq LCD[n,k-2]$ for $k$ even.

21038,Control-Oriented Learning on the Fly,"  This paper focuses on developing a strategy for control of systems whose
dynamics are almost entirely unknown. This situation arises naturally in a
scenario where a system undergoes a critical failure. In that case, it is
imperative to retain the ability to satisfy basic control objectives in order
to avert an imminent catastrophe. A prime example of such an objective is the
reach-avoid problem, where a system needs to move to a certain state in a
constrained state space. To deal with limitations on our knowledge of system
dynamics, we develop a theory of myopic control. The primary goal of myopic
control is to, at any given time, optimize the current direction of the system
trajectory, given solely the information obtained about the system until that
time. We propose an algorithm that uses small perturbations in the control
effort to learn local dynamics while simultaneously ensuring that the system
moves in a direction that appears to be nearly optimal, and provide hard bounds
for its suboptimality. We additionally verify the usefulness of the algorithm
on a simulation of a damaged aircraft seeking to avoid a crash, as well as on
an example of a Van der Pol oscillator.

21039,Multi Agent Driven Data Mining For Knowledge Discovery in Cloud Computing,"  Today, huge amount of data is available on the web. Now there is a need to
convert that data in knowledge which can be useful for different purposes. This
paper depicts the use of data mining process, OLAP with the combination of
multi agent system to find the knowledge from data in cloud computing. For
this, I am also trying to explain one case study of online shopping of one
Bakery Shop. May be we can increase the sale of items by using the model, which
I am trying to represent.
"
21040,Matrix Completion from $O(n)$ Samples in Linear Time,"  We consider the problem of reconstructing a rank-$k$ $n \times n$ matrix $M$
from a sampling of its entries. Under a certain incoherence assumption on $M$
and for the case when both the rank and the condition number of $M$ are
bounded, it was shown in \cite{CandesRecht2009, CandesTao2010, keshavan2010,
Recht2011, Jain2012, Hardt2014} that $M$ can be recovered exactly or
approximately (depending on some trade-off between accuracy and computational
complexity) using $O(n \, \text{poly}(\log n))$ samples in super-linear time
$O(n^{a} \, \text{poly}(\log n))$ for some constant $a \geq 1$.
In this paper, we propose a new matrix completion algorithm using a novel
sampling scheme based on a union of independent sparse random regular bipartite
graphs. We show that under the same conditions w.h.p. our algorithm recovers an
$\epsilon$-approximation of $M$ in terms of the Frobenius norm using $O(n
\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ samples and in linear time $O(n \log^2(1/\epsilon))$. This
provides the best known bounds both on the sample complexity and computational
complexity for reconstructing (approximately) an unknown low-rank matrix.
The novelty of our algorithm is two new steps of thresholding singular values
and rescaling singular vectors in the application of the ""vanilla"" alternating
minimization algorithm. The structure of sparse random regular graphs is used
heavily for controlling the impact of these regularization steps.
"
21041,"Ingestion, Indexing and Retrieval of High-Velocity Multidimensional Sensor Data on a Single Node","  Multidimensional data are becoming more prevalent, partly due to the rise of
the Internet of Things (IoT), and with that the need to ingest and analyze data
streams at rates higher than before. Some industrial IoT applications require
ingesting millions of records per second, while processing queries on recently
ingested and historical data. Unfortunately, existing database systems suited
to multidimensional data exhibit low per-node ingestion performance, and even
if they can scale horizontally in distributed settings, they require large
number of nodes to meet such ingest demands. For this reason, in this paper we
evaluate a single-node multidimensional data store for high-velocity sensor
data. Its design centers around a two-level indexing structure, wherein the
global index is an in-memory R*-tree and the local indices are serialized
kd-trees. This study is confined to records with numerical indexing fields and
range queries, and covers ingest throughput, query response time, and storage
footprint. We show that the adopted design streamlines data ingestion and
offers ingress rates two orders of magnitude higher than those of Percona
Server, SQLite, and Druid. Our prototype also reports query response times
comparable to or better than those of Percona Server and Druid, and compares
favorably in terms of storage footprint. In addition, we evaluate a kd-tree
partitioning based scheme for grouping incoming streamed data records. Compared
to a random scheme, this scheme produces less overlap between groups of
streamed records, but contrary to what we expected, such reduced overlap does
not translate into better query performance. By contrast, the local indices
prove much more beneficial to query performance. We believe the experience
reported in this paper is valuable to practitioners and researchers alike
interested in building database systems for high-velocity multidimensional
data.
"
21042,Electron and thermal transport via Variable Range Hopping in MoSe$_{2}$ single crystals,"  Bulk single crystal Molybdenum diselenide has been studied for its electronic
and thermal transport properties. We perform resistivity measurements with
current in-plane (CIP) and current perpendicular to plane (CPP) as a function
of temperature. The CIP measurements exhibit metal to semiconductor transition
at $\simeq 31$ K. In the semiconducting phase ($T > 31$ K), the transport is
best explained by variable range hopping (VRH) model. Large magnitude of
resistivity in CPP mode indicates strong structural anisotropy. Seebeck
coefficient as a function of temperature measured in the range $90 - 300$ K,
also agrees well with the VRH model. The room temperature Seebeck coefficient
is found to be $139$ $\mu$V/K. VRH fittings of the resistivity and Seebeck
coefficient data indicate high degree of localization.
"
21043,Ball in double hoop: demonstration model for numerical optimal control,"  Ball and hoop system is a well-known model for the education of linear
control systems. In this paper, we have a look at this system from another
perspective and show that it is also suitable for demonstration of more
advanced control techniques. In contrast to the standard use, we describe the
dynamics of the system at full length; in addition to the mode where the ball
rolls on the (outer) hoop we also consider the mode where the ball drops out of
the hoop and enters a free-fall mode. Furthermore, we add another (inner) hoop
in the center upon which the ball can land from the free-fall mode. This
constitutes another mode of the hybrid description of the system. We present
two challenging tasks for this model and show how they can be solved by
trajectory generation and stabilization. We also describe how such a model can
be built and experimentally verify the validity of our approach solving the
proposed tasks.
"
21044,Forecasting market states,"  We propose a novel methodology to define, analyse and forecast market states.
In our approach market states are identified by a reference sparse precision
matrix and a vector of expectation values. In our procedure each multivariate
observation is associated to a given market state accordingly to a penalized
likelihood maximization. The procedure is made computationally very efficient
and can be used with a large number of assets. We demonstrate that this
procedure successfully classifies different states of the markets in an
unsupervised manner. In particular, we describe an experiment with one hundred
log-returns and two states in which the methodology automatically associates
one state to periods with average positive returns and the other state to
periods with average negative returns, therefore discovering spontaneously the
common classification of `bull' and `bear' markets. In another experiment, with
again one hundred log-returns and two states, we demonstrate that this
procedure can be efficiently used to forecast off-sample future market states
with significant prediction accuracy. This methodology opens the way to a range
of applications in risk management and trading strategies where the correlation
structure plays a central role.
"
21045,Planetary Ring Dynamics -- The Streamline Formalism -- 2. Theory of Narrow Rings and Sharp Edges,"  The present material covers the features of large scale ring dynamics in
perturbed flows that were not addressed in part 1 (astro-ph/1606.00759); this
includes an extensive coverage of all kinds of ring modes dynamics (except
density waves which have been covered in part 1), the origin of ring
eccentricities and mode amplitudes, and the issue of ring/gap confinement. This
still leaves aside a number of important dynamical issues relating to the ring
small scale structure, most notably the dynamics of self-gravitational wakes,
of local viscous overstabilities and of ballistic transport processes.
As this material is designed to be self-contained, there is some 30% overlap
with part 1. This work constitutes a preprint of Chapter 11 of the forthcoming
Cambridge University book on rings (Planetary Ring Systems, Matt Tiscareno and
Carl Murray, eds).
"
21046,Parallel Streaming Wasserstein Barycenters,"  Efficiently aggregating data from different sources is a challenging problem,
particularly when samples from each source are distributed differently. These
differences can be inherent to the inference task or present for other reasons:
sensors in a sensor network may be placed far apart, affecting their individual
measurements. Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian
inference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically
distributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability
distributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter
is a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while
respecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and
requires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself.
Improving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-efficient,
parallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary
distributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input
distributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to
nonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that
tracks the input measures over time. The algorithm is semi-discrete, needing to
discretize only the barycenter estimate. To the best of our knowledge, we also
provide the first bounds on the quality of the approximate barycenter as the
discretization becomes finer. Finally, we demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of our method, both in tracking moving distributions on a sphere,
as well as in a large-scale Bayesian inference task.
"
21047,Lecar's visual comparison method to assess the randomness of Bode's law: an answer,"  The usual main objection against any attempt in finding a physical cause for
the planet distance distribution is based on the assumption that similar
distance distribution could be obtained by sequences of random numbers. This
assumption was stated by Lecar in an old paper (1973). We show here how this
assumption is incorrect and how his visual comparison method is inappropriate.
"
21048,GoDP: Globally optimized dual pathway system for facial landmark localization in-the-wild,"  Facial landmark localization is a fundamental module for pose-invariant face
recognition. The most common approach for facial landmark detection is cascaded
regression, which is composed of two steps: feature extraction and facial shape
regression. Recent methods employ deep convolutional networks to extract robust
features for each step, while the whole system could be regarded as a deep
cascaded regression architecture. In this work, instead of employing a deep
regression network, a Globally Optimized Dual-Pathway (GoDP) deep architecture
is proposed to identify the target pixels through solving a cascaded pixel
labeling problem without resorting to high-level inference models or complex
stacked architecture. The proposed end-to-end system relies on distance-aware
softmax functions and dual-pathway proposal-refinement architecture. Results
show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art cascaded regression-based methods
on multiple in-the-wild face alignment databases. The model achieves 1.84
normalized mean error (NME) on the AFLW database, which outperforms 3DDFA by
61.8%. Experiments on face identification demonstrate that GoDP, coupled with
DPM-headhunter, is able to improve rank-1 identification rate by 44.2% compared
to Dlib toolbox on a challenging database.

whose spectrum has density zero.
"
21050,Cell growth rate dictates the onset of glass to fluid-like transition and long time super-diffusion in an evolving cell colony,"  Collective migration dominates many phenomena, from cell movement in living
systems to abiotic self-propelling particles. Focusing on the early stages of
tumor evolution, we enunciate the principles involved in cell dynamics and
highlight their implications in understanding similar behavior in seemingly
unrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of
CD8$^{+}$ T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal
three dimensional model, accounting for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell
interactions as well as cell birth and death to establish that cell growth
rate-dependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological
niches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the
tumor boundary, while motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The
mean square displacement, $\Delta(t)$, of cells exhibits glassy behavior at
times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive
behavior, $\Delta (t) \approx t^{\alpha}$ ($\alpha > 1$), at longer times. We
derive the value of $\alpha \approx 1.33$ using a field theoretic approach
based on stochastic quantization. In the process we establish the universality
of super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium systems.
Super diffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell
birth and death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also
suggests that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative
agreement with {\it in vitro} experiments. Although set in the context of tumor
invasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion in
growing cells and in active systems where creation and annihilation of
particles play a role.
"
21051,Distributed Average Tracking for Lipschitz-Type Nonlinear Dynamical Systems,"  In this paper, a distributed average tracking problem is studied for
Lipschitz-type nonlinear dynamical systems. The objective is to design
distributed average tracking algorithms for locally interactive agents to track
the average of multiple reference signals. Here, in both the agents' and the
reference signals' dynamics, there is a nonlinear term satisfying the
Lipschitz-type condition. Three types of distributed average tracking
algorithms are designed. First, based on state-dependent-gain designing
approaches, a robust distributed average tracking algorithm is developed to
solve distributed average tracking problems without requiring the same initial
condition. Second, by using a gain adaption scheme, an adaptive distributed
average tracking algorithm is proposed in this paper to remove the requirement
that the Lipschitz constant is known for agents. Third, to reduce chattering
and make the algorithms easier to implement, a continuous distributed average
tracking algorithm based on a time-varying boundary layer is further designed
as a continuous approximation of the previous discontinuous distributed average
tracking algorithms.
"
21052,On the Möbius Function and Topology of General Pattern Posets,"  We introduce a formal definition of a pattern poset which encompasses several
previously studied posets in the literature. Using this definition we present
some general results on the Möbius function and topology of such pattern
posets. We prove our results using a poset fibration based on the embeddings of
the poset, where embeddings are representations of occurrences. We show that
the Möbius function of these posets is intrinsically linked to the number of
embeddings, and in particular to so called normal embeddings. We present
results on when topological properties such as Cohen-Macaulayness and
shellability are preserved by this fibration. Furthermore, we apply these
results to some pattern posets and derive alternative proofs of existing
results, such as Björner's results on subword order.
"
21053,A Potapov-type approach to a truncated matricial Stieltjes-type power moment problem,"  The paper gives a parametrization of the solution set of a matricial
Stieltjes-type truncated power moment problem in the non-degenerate and
degenerate cases. The key role plays the solution of the corresponding system
of Potapov's fundamental matrix inequalities.
"
21054,The scaling limit of the KPZ equation in space dimension 3 and higher,"  We study in the present article the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation $$
\partial_t h(t,x)=\nu\Delta h(t,x)+\lambda |\nabla h(t,x)|^2 +\sqrt{D}\,
\eta(t,x), \qquad (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}^d $$ in $d\ge 3$
dimensions in the perturbative regime, i.e. for $\lambda>0$ small enough and a
smooth, bounded, integrable initial condition $h_0=h(t=0,\cdot)$. The forcing
term $\eta$ in the right-hand side is a regularized space-time white noise. The
exponential of $h$ -- its so-called Cole-Hopf transform -- is known to satisfy
a linear PDE with multiplicative noise. We prove a large-scale diffusive limit
for the solution, in particular a time-integrated heat-kernel behavior for the
covariance in a parabolic scaling.
The proof is based on a rigorous implementation of K. Wilson's
renormalization group scheme. A double cluster/momentum-decoupling expansion
allows for perturbative estimates of the bare resolvent of the Cole-Hopf linear
PDE in the small-field region where the noise is not too large, following the
broad lines of Iagolnitzer-Magnen. Standard large deviation estimates for
$\eta$ make it possible to extend the above estimates to the large-field
region. Finally, we show, by resumming all the by-products of the expansion,
that the solution $h$ may be written in the large-scale limit (after a suitable
Galilei transformation) as a small perturbation of the solution of the
underlying linear Edwards-Wilkinson model ($\lambda=0$) with renormalized
coefficients $\nu_{eff}=\nu+O(\lambda^2),D_{eff}=D+O(\lambda^2)$.
"
21055,Beyond Free Riding: Quality of Indicators for Assessing Participation in Information Sharing for Threat Intelligence,"  Threat intelligence sharing has become a growing concept, whereby entities
can exchange patterns of threats with each other, in the form of indicators, to
a community of trust for threat analysis and incident response. However,
sharing threat-related information have posed various risks to an organization
that pertains to its security, privacy, and competitiveness. Given the
coinciding benefits and risks of threat information sharing, some entities have
adopted an elusive behavior of ""free-riding"" so that they can acquire the
benefits of sharing without contributing much to the community. So far,
understanding the effectiveness of sharing has been viewed from the perspective
of the amount of information exchanged as opposed to its quality. In this
paper, we introduce the notion of quality of indicators (\qoi) for the
assessment of the level of contribution by participants in information sharing
for threat intelligence. We exemplify this notion through various metrics,
including correctness, relevance, utility, and uniqueness of indicators. In
order to realize the notion of \qoi, we conducted an empirical study and taken
a benchmark approach to define quality metrics, then we obtained a reference
dataset and utilized tools from the machine learning literature for quality
assessment. We compared these results against a model that only considers the
volume of information as a metric for contribution, and unveiled various
interesting observations, including the ability to spot low quality
contributions that are synonym to free riding in threat information sharing.
"
21056,On the Design of LQR Kernels for Efficient Controller Learning,"  Finding optimal feedback controllers for nonlinear dynamic systems from data
is hard. Recently, Bayesian optimization (BO) has been proposed as a powerful
framework for direct controller tuning from experimental trials. For selecting
the next query point and finding the global optimum, BO relies on a
probabilistic description of the latent objective function, typically a
Gaussian process (GP). As is shown herein, GPs with a common kernel choice can,
however, lead to poor learning outcomes on standard quadratic control problems.
For a first-order system, we construct two kernels that specifically leverage
the structure of the well-known Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), yet retain
the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric learning. Simulations of uncertain
linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate that the LQR kernels yield superior
learning performance.
"
21057,How does propaganda influence the opinion dynamics of a population ?,"  The evolution of opinions in a population of individuals who constantly
interact with a common source of user-generated content (i.e. the internet) and
are also subject to propaganda is analyzed using computer simulations. The
model is based on the bounded confidence approach. In the absence of
propaganda, computer simulations show that the online population as a whole is
either fragmented, polarized or in perfect harmony on a certain issue or
ideology depending on the uncertainty of individuals in accepting opinions not
closer to theirs. On applying the model to simulate radicalization, a
proportion of the online population, subject to extremist propaganda radicalize
depending on their pre-conceived opinions and opinion uncertainty. It is found
that an optimal counter propaganda that prevents radicalization is not
necessarily centrist.
"
21058,Explicit Solution for Constrained Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Control with Multiplicative Noise,"  We study in this paper a class of constrained linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal
control problem formulations for the scalar-state stochastic system with
multiplicative noise, which has various applications, especially in the
financial risk management. The linear constraint on both the control and state
variables considered in our model destroys the elegant structure of the
conventional LQ formulation and has blocked the derivation of an explicit
control policy so far in the literature. We successfully derive in this paper
the analytical control policy for such a class of problems by utilizing the
state separation property induced from its structure. We reveal that the
optimal control policy is a piece-wise affine function of the state and can be
computed off-line efficiently by solving two coupled Riccati equations. Under
some mild conditions, we also obtain the stationary control policy for infinite
time horizon. We demonstrate the implementation of our method via some
illustrative examples and show how to calibrate our model to solve dynamic
constrained portfolio optimization problems.
"
21059,Viewpoint Selection for Photographing Architectures,"  This paper studies the problem of how to choose good viewpoints for taking
photographs of architectures. We achieve this by learning from professional
photographs of world famous landmarks that are available on the Internet.
Unlike previous efforts devoted to photo quality assessment which mainly rely
on 2D image features, we show in this paper combining 2D image features
extracted from images with 3D geometric features computed on the 3D models can
result in more reliable evaluation of viewpoint quality. Specifically, we
collect a set of photographs for each of 15 world famous architectures as well
as their 3D models from the Internet. Viewpoint recovery for images is carried
out through an image-model registration process, after which a newly proposed
viewpoint clustering strategy is exploited to validate users' viewpoint
preferences when photographing landmarks. Finally, we extract a number of 2D
and 3D features for each image based on multiple visual and geometric cues and
perform viewpoint recommendation by learning from both 2D and 3D features using
a specifically designed SVM-2K multi-view learner, achieving superior
performance over using solely 2D or 3D features. We show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach through extensive experiments. The experiments also
demonstrate that our system can be used to recommend viewpoints for rendering
textured 3D models of buildings for the use of architectural design, in
addition to viewpoint evaluation of photographs and recommendation of
viewpoints for photographing architectures in practice.
"
21060,Geophysical tests for habitability in ice-covered ocean worlds,"  Geophysical measurements can reveal the structure of icy ocean worlds and
cycling of volatiles. The associated density, temperature, sound speed, and
electrical conductivity of such worlds thus characterizes their habitability.
To explore the variability and correlation of these parameters, and to provide
tools for planning and data analyses, we develop 1-D calculations of internal
structure, which use available constraints on the thermodynamics of aqueous
MgSO$_4$, NaCl (as seawater), and NH$_3$, water ices, and silicate content.
Limits in available thermodynamic data narrow the parameter space that can be
explored: insufficient coverage in pressure, temperature, and composition for
end-member salinities of MgSO$_4$ and NaCl, and for relevant water ices; and a
dearth of suitable data for aqueous mixtures of Na-Mg-Cl-SO$_4$-NH$_3$. For
Europa, ocean compositions that are oxidized and dominated by MgSO$_4$, vs
reduced (NaCl), illustrate these gaps, but also show the potential for
diagnostic and measurable combinations of geophysical parameters. The
low-density rocky core of Enceladus may comprise hydrated minerals, or anydrous
minerals with high porosity comparable to Earth's upper mantle. Titan's ocean
must be dense, but not necessarily saline, as previously noted, and may have
little or no high-pressure ice at its base. Ganymede's silicious interior is
deepest among all known ocean worlds, and may contain multiple phases of
high-pressure ice, which will become buoyant if the ocean is sufficiently
salty. Callisto's likely near-eutectic ocean cannot be adequately modeled using
available data. Callisto may also lack high-pressure ices, but this cannot be
confirmed due to uncertainty in its moment of inertia.
"
21061,A fast speed planning algorithm for robotic manipulators,"  We consider the speed planning problem for a robotic manipulator. In
particular, we present an algorithm for finding the time-optimal speed law
along an assigned path that satisfies velocity and acceleration constraints and
respects the maximum forces and torques allowed by the actuators. The addressed
optimization problem is a finite dimensional reformulation of the
continuous-time speed optimization problem, obtained by discretizing the speed
profile with N points. The proposed algorithm has linear complexity with
respect to N and to the number of degrees of freedom. Such complexity is the
best possible for this problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed
algorithm is significantly faster than algorithms already existing in
literature.
"
21062,Linearly convergent stochastic heavy ball method for minimizing generalization error,"  In this work we establish the first linear convergence result for the
stochastic heavy ball method. The method performs SGD steps with a fixed
stepsize, amended by a heavy ball momentum term. In the analysis, we focus on
minimizing the expected loss and not on finite-sum minimization, which is
typically a much harder problem. While in the analysis we constrain ourselves
to quadratic loss, the overall objective is not necessarily strongly convex.

21063,Applying the Spacecraft with a Solar Sail to Form the Climate on a Mars Base,"  This article is devoted to research the application of the spacecraft with a
solar sail to support the certain climatic conditions in an area of the Mars
surface. Authors propose principles of functioning of the spacecraft, intended
to create a light and thermal light spot in a predetermined area of the Martian
surface. The mathematical motion model in such condition of the solar sail's
orientation is considered and used for motion simulation session. Moreover, the
analysis of this motion is performed. Thus, were obtained parameters of the
stationary orbit of the spacecraft with a solar sail and were given
recommendations for further applying spacecrafts to reflect the sunlight on a
planet's surface.
"
21064,Data processing pipeline for Herschel HIFI,"  {Context}. The HIFI instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory performed
over 9100 astronomical observations, almost 900 of which were calibration
observations in the course of the nearly four-year Herschel mission. The data
from each observation had to be converted from raw telemetry into calibrated
products and were included in the Herschel Science Archive. {Aims}. The HIFI
pipeline was designed to provide robust conversion from raw telemetry into
calibrated data throughout all phases of the HIFI missions. Pre-launch
laboratory testing was supported as were routine mission operations. {Methods}.
A modular software design allowed components to be easily added, removed,
amended and/or extended as the understanding of the HIFI data developed during
and after mission operations. {Results}. The HIFI pipeline processed data from
all HIFI observing modes within the Herschel automated processing environment
as well as within an interactive environment. The same software can be used by
the general astronomical community to reprocess any standard HIFI observation.
The pipeline also recorded the consistency of processing results and provided
automated quality reports. Many pipeline modules were in use since the HIFI
pre-launch instrument level testing. {Conclusions}. Processing in steps
facilitated data analysis to discover and address instrument artefacts and
uncertainties. The availability of the same pipeline components from pre-launch
throughout the mission made for well-understood, tested, and stable processing.
A smooth transition from one phase to the next significantly enhanced
processing reliability and robustness.
"
21065,Regret Analysis for Continuous Dueling Bandit,"  The dueling bandit is a learning framework wherein the feedback information
in the learning process is restricted to a noisy comparison between a pair of
actions. In this research, we address a dueling bandit problem based on a cost
function over a continuous space. We propose a stochastic mirror descent
algorithm and show that the algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$-regret
bound under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions for the cost function.
Subsequently, we clarify the equivalence between regret minimization in dueling
bandit and convex optimization for the cost function. Moreover, when
considering a lower bound in convex optimization, our algorithm is shown to
achieve the optimal convergence rate in convex optimization and the optimal
regret in dueling bandit except for a logarithmic factor.

21066,X-ray induced deuterium enrichment on N-rich organics in protoplanetary disks: an experimental investigation using synchrotron light,"  The deuterium enrichment of organics in the interstellar medium,
protoplanetary disks and meteorites has been proposed to be the result of
ionizing radiation. The goal of this study is to quantify the effects of soft
X-rays (0.1 - 2 keV), a component of stellar radiation fields illuminating
protoplanetary disks, on the refractory organics present in the disks. We
prepared tholins, nitrogen-rich complex organics, via plasma deposition and
used synchrotron radiation to simulate X-ray fluences in protoplanetary disks.
Controlled irradiation experiments at 0.5 and 1.3 keV were performed at the
SEXTANTS beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron, and were followed by ex-situ
infrared, Raman and isotopic diagnostics. Infrared spectroscopy revealed the
loss of singly-bonded groups (N-H, C-H and R-N$\equiv$C) and the formation of
sp$^3$ carbon defects. Raman analysis revealed the introduction of defects and
structural amorphization. Finally, tholins were measured via secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS), revealing that significant D-enrichment is induced by
X-ray irradiation. Our results are compared to previous experimental studies
involving the thermal degradation and electron irradiation of organics. The
penetration depth of soft X-rays in $\mu$m-sized tholins leads to volume rather
than surface modifications: lower energy X-rays (0.5 keV) induce a larger
D-enrichment than 1.3 keV X-rays, reaching a plateau for doses larger than 5
$\times$ 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-3}$. Our work provides experimental evidence of a
new non-thermal pathway to deuterium fractionation of organic matter.

21067,Parisian ruin of Brownian motion risk model over an infinite-time horizon,"  Let $B(t), t\in \mathbb{R}$ be a standard Brownian motion. In this paper, we
derive the exact asymptotics of the probability of Parisian ruin on infinite
time horizon for the following risk process \begin{align}\label{Rudef}
R_u^{\delta}(t)=e^{\delta t}\left(u+c\int^{t}_{0}e^{-\delta v}d
v-\sigma\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\delta v}d B(v)\right),\quad t\geq0, \end{align} where
$u\geq 0$ is the initial reserve, $\delta\geq0$ is the force of interest, $c>0$
is the rate of premium and $\sigma>0$ is a volatility factor.
Further, we show the asymptotics of the Parisian ruin time of this risk
process.
"
21068,"Exogeneity tests, incomplete models, weak identification and non-Gaussian distributions: invariance and finite-sample distributional theory","  We study the distribution of Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) and Revankar-Hartley
(RH) tests for exogeneity from a finite-sample viewpoint, under the null and
alternative hypotheses. We consider linear structural models with possibly
non-Gaussian errors, where structural parameters may not be identified and
where reduced forms can be incompletely specified (or nonparametric). On level
control, we characterize the null distributions of all the test statistics.
Through conditioning and invariance arguments, we show that these distributions
do not involve nuisance parameters. In particular, this applies to several test
statistics for which no finite-sample distributional theory is yet available,
such as the standard statistic proposed by Hausman (1978). The distributions of
the test statistics may be non-standard -- so corrections to usual asymptotic
critical values are needed -- but the characterizations are sufficiently
explicit to yield finite-sample (Monte-Carlo) tests of the exogeneity
hypothesis. The procedures so obtained are robust to weak identification,
missing instruments or misspecified reduced forms, and can easily be adapted to
allow for parametric non-Gaussian error distributions. We give a general
invariance result (block triangular invariance) for exogeneity test statistics.
This property yields a convenient exogeneity canonical form and a parsimonious
reduction of the parameters on which power depends. In the extreme case where
no structural parameter is identified, the distributions under the alternative
hypothesis and the null hypothesis are identical, so the power function is
flat, for all the exogeneity statistics. However, as soon as identification
does not fail completely, this phenomenon typically disappears.
"
21069,Pair formation of hard core bosons in flat band systems,"  Hard core bosons in a large class of one or two dimensional flat band systems
have an upper critical density, below which the ground states can be described
completely. At the critical density, the ground states are Wigner crystals. If
one adds a particle to the system at the critical density, the ground state and
the low lying multi particle states of the system can be described as a Wigner
crystal with an additional pair of particles. The energy band for the pair is
separated from the rest of the multi-particle spectrum. The proofs use a
Gerschgorin type of argument for block diagonally dominant matrices. In certain
one-dimensional or tree-like structures one can show that the pair is
localised, for example in the chequerboard chain. For this one-dimensional
system with periodic boundary condition the energy band for the pair is flat,
the pair is localised.

21070,"A Note on the Relationship Between Conditional and Unconditional Independence, and its Extensions for Markov Kernels","  Two known results on the relationship between conditional and unconditional
independence are obtained as a consequence of the main result of this paper, a
theorem that uses independence of Markov kernels to obtain a minimal condition
which added to conditional independence implies independence. Some
counterexamples and representation results are provided to clarify the concepts
introduced and the propositions of the statement of the main theorem. Moreover,
conditional independence and the mentioned results are extended to the
framework of Markov kernels.
"
21071,The Effect of Temperature on Amdahl Law in 3D Multicore Era,"  This work studies the influence of temperature on performance and scalability
of 3D Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) from Amdahl law perspective. We find that 3D
CMP may reach its thermal limit before reaching its maximum power. We show that
a high level of parallelism may lead to high peak temperatures even in small
scale 3D CMPs, thus limiting 3D CMP scalability and calling for different,
in-memory computing architectures.
"
21072,Video Object Segmentation using Supervoxel-Based Gerrymandering,"  Pixels operate locally. Superpixels have some potential to collect
information across many pixels; supervoxels have more potential by implicitly
operating across time. In this paper, we explore this well established notion
thoroughly analyzing how supervoxels can be used in place of and in conjunction
with other means of aggregating information across space-time. Focusing on the
problem of strictly unsupervised video object segmentation, we devise a method
called supervoxel gerrymandering that links masks of foregroundness and
backgroundness via local and non-local consensus measures. We pose and answer a
series of critical questions about the ability of supervoxels to adequately
sway local voting; the questions regard type and scale of supervoxels as well
as local versus non-local consensus, and the questions are posed in a general
way so as to impact the broader knowledge of the use of supervoxels in video
understanding. We work with the DAVIS dataset and find that our analysis yields
an unsupervised method that outperforms all other known unsupervised methods
and even many supervised ones.
"
21073,The Absent-Minded Driver Problem Redux,"  This paper reconsiders the problem of the absent-minded driver who must
choose between alternatives with different payoff with imperfect recall and
varying degrees of knowledge of the system. The classical absent-minded driver
problem represents the case with limited information and it has bearing on the
general area of communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design,
auctions, theories of knowledge, belief, and rational agency. Within the
framework of extensive games, this problem has applications to many artificial
intelligence scenarios. It is obvious that the performance of the agent
improves as information available increases. It is shown that a non-uniform
assignment strategy for successive choices does better than a fixed probability
strategy. We consider both classical and quantum approaches to the problem. We
argue that the superior performance of quantum decisions with access to
entanglement cannot be fairly compared to a classical algorithm. If the
cognitive systems of agents are taken to have access to quantum resources, or
have a quantum mechanical basis, then that can be leveraged into superior
performance.
"
21074,Real-time Acceleration-continuous Path-constrained Trajectory Planning With Built-in Tradability Between Cruise and Time-optimal Motions,"  In this paper, a novel real-time acceleration-continuous path-constrained
trajectory planning algorithm is proposed with an appealing built-in
tradability mechanism between cruise motion and time-optimal motion. Different
from existing approaches, the proposed approach smoothens time-optimal
trajectories with bang-bang input structures to generate
acceleration-continuous trajectories while preserving the completeness
property. More importantly, a novel built-in tradability mechanism is proposed
and embedded into the trajectory planning framework, so that the proportion of
the cruise motion and time-optimal motion can be flexibly adjusted by changing
a user-specified functional parameter. Thus, the user can easily apply the
trajectory planning algorithm for various tasks with different requirements on
motion efficiency and cruise proportion. Moreover, it is shown that feasible
trajectories are computed more quickly than optimal trajectories. Rigorous
mathematical analysis and proofs are provided for these aforementioned results.
Comparative simulation and experimental results on omnidirectional wheeled
mobile robots demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm in terms of
flexible tunning between cruise and time-optimal motions, as well as higher
computational efficiency.
"
21075,Multi-locus data distinguishes between population growth and multiple merger coalescents,"  We introduce a low dimensional function of the site frequency spectrum that
is tailor-made for distinguishing coalescent models with multiple mergers from
Kingman coalescent models with population growth, and use this function to
construct a hypothesis test between these model classes. The null and
alternative sampling distributions of the statistic are intractable, but its
low dimensionality renders them amenable to Monte Carlo estimation. We
construct kernel density estimates of the sampling distributions based on
simulated data, and show that the resulting hypothesis test dramatically
improves on the statistical power of a current state-of-the-art method. A key
reason for this improvement is the use of multi-locus data, in particular
averaging observed site frequency spectra across unlinked loci to reduce
sampling variance. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to nuisance
and tuning parameters. Finally we show that the same kernel density estimates
can be used to conduct parameter estimation, and argue that our method is
readily generalisable for applications in model selection, parameter inference
and experimental design.
"
21076,Ramsey interferometry of Rydberg ensembles inside microwave cavities,"  We study ensembles of Rydberg atoms in a confined electromagnetic environment
such as provided by a microwave cavity. The competition between standard free
space Ising type and cavity-mediated interactions leads to the emergence of
different regimes where the particle-particle couplings range from the typical
van der Waals $r^{-6}$ behavior to $r^{-3}$ and to $r$-independence. We apply a
Ramsey spectroscopic technique to map the two-body interactions into a
characteristic signal such as intensity and contrast decay curves. As opposed
to previous treatments requiring high-densities for considerable contrast and
phase decay, the cavity scenario can exhibit similar behavior at much lower
densities.
"
21077,Impurity self-energy in the strongly-correlated Bose systems,"  We proposed the non-perturbative scheme for calculation of the impurity
spectrum in the Bose system at zero temperature. The method is based on the
path-integral formulation and describes an impurity as a zero-density ideal
Fermi gas interacting with Bose system for which the action is written in terms
of density fluctuations. On the example of the $^3$He atom immersed in the
liquid helium-4 a good consistency with experimental data and results of Monte
Carlo simulations is shown.
"
21078,$k$-step correction for mixed integer linear programming: a new approach for instrumental variable quantile regressions and related problems,"  This paper proposes a new framework for estimating instrumental variable (IV)
quantile models. The first part of our proposal can be cast as a mixed integer
linear program (MILP), which allows us to capitalize on recent progress in
mixed integer optimization. The computational advantage of the proposed method
makes it an attractive alternative to existing estimators in the presence of
multiple endogenous regressors. This is a situation that arises naturally when
one endogenous variable is interacted with several other variables in a
regression equation. In our simulations, the proposed method using MILP with a
random starting point can reliably estimate regressions for a sample size of
500 with 20 endogenous variables in 5 seconds. Theoretical results for early
termination of MILP are also provided. The second part of our proposal is a
$k$-step correction framework, which is proved to be able to convert any point
within a small but fixed neighborhood of the true parameter value into an
estimate that is asymptotically equivalent to GMM. Our result does not require
the initial estimate to be consistent and only $2\log n$ iterations are needed.
Since the $k$-step correction does not require any optimization, applying the
$k$-step correction to MILP estimate provides a computationally attractive way
of obtaining efficient estimators. When dealing with very large data sets, we
can run the MILP algorithm on only a small subsample and our theoretical
results guarantee that the resulting estimator from the $k$-step correction is
equivalent to computing GMM on the full sample. As a result, we can handle
massive datasets of millions of observations within seconds. As an empirical
illustration, we examine the heterogeneous treatment effect of Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA) using a regression with 13 interaction terms of the
treatment variable.
"
21079,An MCMC Algorithm for Estimating the Reduced RUM,"  The RRUM is a model that is frequently seen in language assessment studies.
The objective of this research is to advance an MCMC algorithm for the Bayesian
RRUM. The algorithm starts with estimating correlated attributes. Using a
saturated model and a binary decimal conversion, the algorithm transforms
possible attribute patterns to a Multinomial distribution. Along with the
likelihood of an attribute pattern, a Dirichlet distribution is used as the
prior to sample from the posterior. The Dirichlet distribution is constructed
using Gamma distributions. Correlated attributes of examinees are generated
using the inverse transform sampling. Model parameters are estimated using the
Metropolis within Gibbs sampler sequentially. Two simulation studies are
conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The first simulation
uses a complete and balanced Q-matrix that measures 5 attributes. Comprised of
28 items and 9 attributes, the Q-matrix for the second simulation is incomplete
and imbalanced. The empirical study uses the ECPE data obtained from the CDM R
package. Parameter estimates from the MCMC algorithm and from the CDM R package
are presented and compared. The algorithm developed in this research is
implemented in R.
"
21080,Stretching p-wave molecules by transverse confinements,"  We revisit the confinement-induced p-wave resonance in quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) atomic gases and study the induced molecules near resonance. We
derive the reduced 1D interaction parameters and show that they can well
predict the binding energy of shallow molecules in quasi-1D system.
Importantly, these shallow molecules are found to be much more spatially
extended compared to those in three dimensions (3D) without transverse
confinement. Our results strongly indicate that a p-wave interacting atomic gas
can be much more stable in quasi-1D near the induced p-wave resonance, where
most weight of the molecule lies outside the short-range regime and thus the
atom loss could be suppressed.
"
21081,A Conceptual Framework for Supporting a Rapid Design of Web Applications for Data Analysis of Electrical Quality Assurance Data for the LHC,"  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the most complex machines ever
build. It is composed of many components which constitute a large system. The
tunnel and the accelerator is just one of a very critical fraction of the whole
LHC infrastructure. Hardware comissioning as one of the critical processes
before running the LHC is implemented during the Long Shutdown (LS) states of
the macine, where Electrical Quality Assurance (ELQA) is one of its key
components. Here a huge data is collected when implementing various ELQA
electrical tests. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for
supporting a rapid design of web applications for ELQA data analysis. We show a
framework's main components, their possible integration with other systems and
machine learning algorithms and a simple use case of prototyping an application
for Electrical Quality Assurance of the LHC.
"
21082,The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a Multilingual Corpus of Translations Annotated with Compositional Meaning Representations,"  The Parallel Meaning Bank is a corpus of translations annotated with shared,
formal meaning representations comprising over 11 million words divided over
four languages (English, German, Italian, and Dutch). Our approach is based on
cross-lingual projection: automatically produced (and manually corrected)
semantic annotations for English sentences are mapped onto their word-aligned
translations, assuming that the translations are meaning-preserving. The
semantic annotation consists of five main steps: (i) segmentation of the text
in sentences and lexical items; (ii) syntactic parsing with Combinatory
Categorial Grammar; (iii) universal semantic tagging; (iv) symbolization; and
(v) compositional semantic analysis based on Discourse Representation Theory.
These steps are performed using statistical models trained in a semi-supervised
manner. The employed annotation models are all language-neutral. Our first
results are promising.
"
21083,A nonparametric copula approach to conditional Value-at-Risk,"  Value-at-Risk and its conditional allegory, which takes into account the
available information about the economic environment, form the centrepiece of
the Basel framework for the evaluation of market risk in the banking sector. In
this paper, a new nonparametric framework for estimating this conditional
Value-at-Risk is presented. A nonparametric approach is particularly pertinent
as the traditionally used parametric distributions have been shown to be
insufficiently robust and flexible in most of the equity-return data sets
observed in practice. The method extracts the quantile of the conditional
distribution of interest, whose estimation is based on a novel estimator of the
density of the copula describing the dynamic dependence observed in the series
of returns. Real-world back-testing analyses demonstrate the potential of the
approach, whose performance may be superior to its industry counterparts.
"
21084,Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices,"  Superfluidity is a special state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum
phenomena and acting like a fluid with zero viscosity. In such a state,
superfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with
unique distributions. This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual
understanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear
Klein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to
special vortex lattice/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation,
reconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc. By formulating a numerical model with
theoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality
superfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex
visualization. By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a
new vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with
velocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane
strategy to avoid ambiguity. Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various
superfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual
analysis, such as the steady vortex lattice/ring structures, dynamic vortex
string interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous
Kelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed. These
visualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and
further explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.
"
21085,Nonrepetitive edge-colorings of trees,"  A repetition is a sequence of symbols in which the first half is the same as
the second half. An edge-coloring of a graph is repetition-free or
nonrepetitive if there is no path with a color pattern that is a repetition.
The minimum number of colors so that a graph has a nonrepetitive edge-coloring
is called its Thue edge-chromatic number.
We improve on the best known general upper bound of $4\Delta-4$ for the Thue
edge-chromatic number of trees of maximum degree $\Delta$ due to Alon,
Grytczuk, Ha{\l}uszczak and Riordan (2002) by providing a simple nonrepetitive
edge-coloring with $3\Delta-2$ colors.
"
21086,On the new wave behavior to the longitudinal wave quation in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod,"  With the aid of the symbolic computations software; Wolfram Mathematica 9,
the powerful sine-Gordon expansion method is used in examining the analytical
solution of the longitudinal wave equation in a magneto-electro-elastic
circular rod. Sine-Gordon expansion method is based on the well-known
sine-Gordon equation and a wave transformation. The longitudinal wave equation
is an equation that arises in mathematical physics with dispersion caused by
the transverse Poisson's effect in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod. We
successfully get some solutions with the complex, trigonometric and hyperbolic
function structure. We present the numerical simulations of all the obtained
solutions by choosing appropriate values of the parameters. We give the
physical meanings of some of the obtained analytical solutions which
significantly explain some practical physical problems.
"
21087,Formulation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture Toward Autonomous Driving for On-Ramp Merge,"  Multiple automakers have in development or in production automated driving
systems (ADS) that offer freeway-pilot functions. This type of ADS is typically
limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual
to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed
manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that
the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives
(e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely
executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other
vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the
merging vehicle optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem,
we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an
optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive
environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state
containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network
(DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal
state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this
DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the
long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the
optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be
extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving
through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow
conditions.
"
21088,CDS Rate Construction Methods by Machine Learning Techniques,"  Regulators require financial institutions to estimate counterparty default
risks from liquid CDS quotes for the valuation and risk management of OTC
derivatives. However, the vast majority of counterparties do not have liquid
CDS quotes and need proxy CDS rates. Existing methods cannot account for
counterparty-specific default risks; we propose to construct proxy CDS rates by
associating to illiquid counterparty liquid CDS Proxy based on Machine Learning
Techniques. After testing 156 classifiers from 8 most popular classifier
families, we found that some classifiers achieve highly satisfactory accuracy
rates. Furthermore, we have rank-ordered the performances and investigated
performance variations amongst and within the 8 classifier families. This paper
is, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic study of CDS Proxy
construction by Machine Learning techniques, and the first systematic
classifier comparison study based entirely on financial market data. Its
findings both confirm and contrast existing classifier performance literature.
Given the typically highly correlated nature of financial data, we investigated
the impact of correlation on classifier performance. The techniques used in
this paper should be of interest for financial institutions seeking a CDS Proxy
method, and can serve for proxy construction for other financial variables.
Some directions for future research are indicated.
"
21089,Eigentriads and Eigenprogressions on the Tonnetz,"  We introduce a new multidimensional representation, named eigenprogression
transform, that characterizes some essential patterns of Western tonal harmony
while being equivariant to time shifts and pitch transpositions. This
representation is deep, multiscale, and convolutional in the piano-roll domain,
yet incurs no prior training, and is thus suited to both supervised and
unsupervised MIR tasks. The eigenprogression transform combines ideas from the
spiral scattering transform, spectral graph theory, and wavelet shrinkage
denoising. We report state-of-the-art results on a task of supervised composer
recognition (Haydn vs. Mozart) from polyphonic music pieces in MIDI format.
"
21090,A generalization of the Log Lindley distribution -- its properties and applications,"  An extension of the two-parameter Log-Lindley distribution of Gomez et al.
(2014) with support in (0, 1) is proposed. Its important properties like
cumulative distribution function, moments, survival function, hazard rate
function, Shannon entropy, stochastic n ordering and convexity (concavity)
conditions are derived. An application in distorted premium principal is
outlined and parameter estimation by method of maximum likelihood is also
presented. We also consider use of a re-parameterized form of the proposed
distribution in regression modeling for bounded responses by considering a
modeling of real life data in comparison with beta regression and log-Lindley
regression models.
"
21091,A Flux Conserving Meshfree Method for Conservation Laws,"  Lack of conservation has been the biggest drawback in meshfree generalized
finite difference methods (GFDMs). In this paper, we present a novel
modification of classical meshfree GFDMs to include local balances which
produce an approximate conservation of numerical fluxes. This numerical flux
conservation is done within the usual moving least squares framework. Unlike
Finite Volume Methods, it is based on locally defined control cells, rather
than a globally defined mesh. We present the application of this method to an
advection diffusion equation and the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations.
Our simulations show that the introduction of flux conservation significantly
reduces the errors in conservation in meshfree GFDMs.
"
21092,Anomaly detection in the dynamics of web and social networks,"  In this work, we propose a new, fast and scalable method for anomaly
detection in large time-evolving graphs. It may be a static graph with dynamic
node attributes (e.g. time-series), or a graph evolving in time, such as a
temporal network. We define an anomaly as a localized increase in temporal
activity in a cluster of nodes. The algorithm is unsupervised. It is able to
detect and track anomalous activity in a dynamic network despite the noise from
multiple interfering sources. We use the Hopfield network model of memory to
combine the graph and time information. We show that anomalies can be spotted
with a good precision using a memory network. The presented approach is
scalable and we provide a distributed implementation of the algorithm. To
demonstrate its efficiency, we apply it to two datasets: Enron Email dataset
and Wikipedia page views. We show that the anomalous spikes are triggered by
the real-world events that impact the network dynamics. Besides, the structure
of the clusters and the analysis of the time evolution associated with the
detected events reveals interesting facts on how humans interact, exchange and
search for information, opening the door to new quantitative studies on
collective and social behavior on large and dynamic datasets.
"
21093,Local coefficients and the Herbert Formula,"  We discuss a generalisation of the Herbert formula for double points, when
the normal bundle of an immersion admits an additional structure, and an
application.
"
21094,Emission line ratios of Fe III as astrophysical plasma diagnostics,"  Recent state-of-the-art calculations of A-values and electron impact
excitation rates for Fe III are used in conjunction with the Cloudy modeling
code to derive emission line intensity ratios for optical transitions among the
fine-structure levels of the 3d$^6$ configuration. A comparison of these with
high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of gaseous nebulae reveals that
previous discrepancies found between theory and observation are not fully
resolved by the latest atomic data. Blending is ruled out as a likely cause of
the discrepancies, because temperature- and density-independent ratios (arising
from lines with common upper levels) match well with those predicted by theory.
For a typical nebular plasma with electron temperature $T_{\rm e} = 9000$ K and
electron density $\rm N_{e}=10^4 \, cm^{-3}$, cascading of electrons from the
levels $\rm ^3G_5$, $\rm ^3G_4$ and $\rm ^3G_3$ plays an important role in
determining the populations of lower levels, such as $\rm ^3F_4$, which provide
the density diagnostic emission lines of Fe III, such as $\rm ^5D_4$ - $\rm
^3F_4$ at 4658 \AA. Hence further work on the A-values for these transitions is
recommended, ideally including measurements if possible. However, some Fe III
ratios do provide reliable $N_{\rm e}$-diagnostics, such as 4986/4658. The Fe
III cooling function calculated with Cloudy using the most recent atomic data
is found to be significantly greater at $T_e$ $\simeq$ 30000 K than predicted
with the existing Cloudy model. This is due to the presence of additional
emission lines with the new data, particularly in the 1000--4000 \AA\
wavelength region.
"
21095,"Warped cones, (non-)rigidity, and piecewise properties, with a joint appendix with Dawid Kielak","  We prove that if a quasi-isometry of warped cones is induced by a map between
the base spaces of the cones, the actions must be conjugate by this map. The
converse is false in general, conjugacy of actions is not sufficient for
quasi-isometry of the respective warped cones. For a general quasi-isometry of
warped cones, using the asymptotically faithful covering constructed in a
previous work with Jianchao Wu, we deduce that the two groups are
quasi-isometric after taking Cartesian products with suitable powers of the
integers.
Secondly, we characterise geometric properties of a group (coarse
embeddability into Banach spaces, asymptotic dimension, property A) by
properties of the warped cone over an action of this group. These results apply
to arbitrary asymptotically faithful coverings, in particular to box spaces. As
an application, we calculate the asymptotic dimension of a warped cone, improve
bounds by Szabó, Wu, and Zacharias and by Bartels on the amenability
dimension of actions of virtually nilpotent groups, and give a partial answer
to a question of Willett about dynamic asymptotic dimension.
In the appendix, we justify optimality of the aforementioned result on
general quasi-isometries by showing that quasi-isometric warped cones need not
come from quasi-isometric groups, contrary to the case of box spaces.
"
21096,Enhancing MapReduce Fault Recovery Through Binocular Speculation,"  MapReduce speculation plays an important role in finding potential task
stragglers and failures. But a tacit dichotomy exists in MapReduce due to its
inherent two-phase (map and reduce) management scheme in which map tasks and
reduce tasks have distinctly different execution behaviors, yet reduce tasks
are dependent on the results of map tasks. We reveal that speculation policies
for fault handling in MapReduce do not recognize this dichotomy between map and
reduce tasks, which leads to an issue of speculation myopia for MapReduce fault
recovery. These issues cause significant performance degradation upon network
and node failures. To address the speculation myopia caused by MapReduce
dichotomy, we introduce a new scheme called binocular speculation to help
MapReduce increase its assessment scope for speculation. As part of the scheme,
we also design three component techniques including neighborhood glance,
collective speculation and speculative rollback. Our evaluation shows that,
with these techniques, binocular speculation can increase the coordination of
map and reduce phases, and enhance the efficiency of MapReduce fault recovery.
"
21097,Generalized classes of continuous symmetries in two-mode Dicke models,"  As recently realized experimentally [Léonard et al., Nature 543, 87
(2017)], one can engineer models with continuous symmetries by coupling two
cavity modes to trapped atoms, via a Raman pumping geometry. Considering
specifically cases where internal states of the atoms couple to the cavity, we
show an extended range of parameters for which continuous symmetry breaking can
occur, and we classify the distinct steady states and time-dependent states
that arise for different points in this extended parameter regime.
"
21098,The strong Prikry property,"  I isolate a combinatorial property of a poset $\mathbb{P}$ that I call the
strong Prikry property, which implies the existence of an ultrafilter on the
complete Boolean algebra $\mathbb{B}$ of $\mathbb{P}$ such that one inclusion
of the Boolean ultrapower version of the so-called \Bukovsky-Dehornoy
phenomenon holds with respect to $\mathbb{B}$ and $U$. I show that in all cases
that were previously studied, and for which it was shown that they come with a
canonical iterated ultrapower construction whose limit can be described as a
single Boolean ultrapower, the posets in question satisfy this property: Prikry
forcing, Magidor forcing and generalized Prikry forcing.
"
21099,Accelerated Optimization in the PDE Framework: Formulations for the Manifold of Diffeomorphisms,"  We consider the problem of optimization of cost functionals on the
infinite-dimensional manifold of diffeomorphisms. We present a new class of
optimization methods, valid for any optimization problem setup on the space of
diffeomorphisms by generalizing Nesterov accelerated optimization to the
manifold of diffeomorphisms. While our framework is general for infinite
dimensional manifolds, we specifically treat the case of diffeomorphisms,
motivated by optical flow problems in computer vision. This is accomplished by
building on a recent variational approach to a general class of accelerated
optimization methods by Wibisono, Wilson and Jordan, which applies in finite
dimensions. We generalize that approach to infinite dimensional manifolds. We
derive the surprisingly simple continuum evolution equations, which are partial
differential equations, for accelerated gradient descent, and relate it to
simple mechanical principles from fluid mechanics. Our approach has natural
connections to the optimal mass transport problem. This is because one can
think of our approach as an evolution of an infinite number of particles
endowed with mass (represented with a mass density) that moves in an energy
landscape. The mass evolves with the optimization variable, and endows the
particles with dynamics. This is different than the finite dimensional case
where only a single particle moves and hence the dynamics does not depend on
the mass. We derive the theory, compute the PDEs for accelerated optimization,
and illustrate the behavior of these new accelerated optimization schemes.
"
21100,Learning Generalizable Robot Skills from Demonstrations in Cluttered Environments,"  Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach to endowing robots
with skills without having to program them by hand. Typically, LfD relies on
human demonstrations in clutter-free environments. This prevents the
demonstrations from being affected by irrelevant objects, whose influence can
obfuscate the true intention of the human or the constraints of the desired
skill. However, it is unrealistic to assume that the robot's environment can
always be restructured to remove clutter when capturing human demonstrations.
To contend with this problem, we develop an importance weighted batch and
incremental skill learning approach, building on a recent inference-based
technique for skill representation and reproduction. Our approach reduces
unwanted environmental influences on the learned skill, while still capturing
the salient human behavior. We provide both batch and incremental versions of
our approach and validate our algorithms on a 7-DOF JACO2 manipulator with
reaching and placing skills.
"
21101,Women are slightly more cooperative than men (in one-shot Prisoner's dilemma games played online),"  Differences between men and women have intrigued generations of social
scientists, who have found that the two sexes behave differently in settings
requiring competition, risk taking, altruism, honesty, as well as many others.
Yet, little is known about whether there are gender differences in cooperative
behavior. Previous evidence is mixed and inconclusive. Here I shed light on
this topic by analyzing the totality of studies that my research group has
conducted since 2013. This is a dataset of 10,951 observations coming from
7,322 men and women living in the US, recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk,
and who passed four comprehension questions to make sure they understand the
cooperation problem (a one-shot prisoner's dilemma). The analysis demonstrates
that women are more cooperative than men. The effect size is small (about 4
percentage points, and this might explain why previous studies failed to detect
it) but highly significant (p<.0001).
"
21102,Relaxation of Radiation-Driven Two-Level Systems Interacting with a Bose-Einstein Condensate Bath,"  We develop a microscopic theory for the relaxation dynamics of an optically
pumped two-level system (TLS) coupled to a bath of weakly interacting Bose gas.
Using Keldysh formalism and diagrammatic perturbation theory, expressions for
the relaxation times of the TLS Rabi oscillations are derived when the boson
bath is in the normal state and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. We
apply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a
boson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath
is in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both
condensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light
coupling and dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light
coupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the
normal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi
oscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump
field frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath
is in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the
dipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation
rate on both the pump field frequency and field strength, providing a
characteristic signature for the detection of BEC phase transition of the
coupled dipolar exciton gas.

21103,On the approximation of convex bodies by ellipses with respect to the symmetric difference metric,"  Given a centrally symmetric convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a
positive number $\lambda$, we consider, among all ellipsoids $E \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ of volume $\lambda$, those that best approximate $K$ with respect
to the symmetric difference metric, or equivalently that maximize the volume of
$E\cap K$: these are the maximal intersection (MI) ellipsoids introduced by
Artstein-Avidan and Katzin. The question of uniqueness of MI ellipsoids (under
the obviously necessary assumption that $\lambda$ is between the volumes of the
John and the Loewner ellipsoids of $K$) is open in general. We provide a
positive answer to this question in dimension $d=2$. Therefore we obtain a
continuous $1$-parameter family of ellipses interpolating between the John and
the Loewner ellipses of $K$. In order to prove uniqueness, we show that the
area $I_K(E)$ of the intersection $K \cap E$ is a strictly quasiconcave
function of the ellipse $E$, with respect to the natural affine structure on
the set of ellipses of area $\lambda$. The proof relies on smoothening $K$,
putting it in general position, and obtaining uniform estimates for certain
derivatives of the function $I_K(.)$. Finally, we provide a characterization of
maximal intersection positions, that is, the situation where the MI ellipse of
$K$ is the unit disk, under the assumption that the two boundaries are
transverse.

21104,POLAMI: Polarimetric Monitoring of Active Galactic Nuclei at Millimetre Wavelengths. II. Widespread circular polarisation,"  We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of
the POLAMI project introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the
3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one
of our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most
sources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is
broader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)
circular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the
maximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,
all made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating
circular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose
that the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength
sample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly
polarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.
Circular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or
shorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about
one year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the
signal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the
sign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,
including 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees
of circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We
do find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in
synchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel
method for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations.
"
21105,Single Classifier-based Passive System for Source Printer Classification using Local Texture Features,"  An important aspect of examining printed documents for potential forgeries
and copyright infringement is the identification of source printer as it can be
helpful for ascertaining the leak and detecting forged documents. This paper
proposes a system for classification of source printer from scanned images of
printed documents using all the printed letters simultaneously. This system
uses local texture patterns based features and a single classifier for
classifying all the printed letters. Letters are extracted from scanned images
using connected component analysis followed by morphological filtering without
the need of using an OCR. Each letter is sub-divided into a flat region and an
edge region, and local tetra patterns are estimated separately for these two
regions. A strategically constructed pooling technique is used to extract the
final feature vectors. The proposed method has been tested on both a publicly
available dataset of 10 printers and a new dataset of 18 printers scanned at a
resolution of 600 dpi as well as 300 dpi printed in four different fonts. The
results indicate shape independence property in the proposed method as using a
single classifier it outperforms existing handcrafted feature-based methods and
needs much smaller number of training pages by using all the printed letters.
"
21106,Heat spreader with parallel microchannel configurations employing nanofluids for near active cooling of MEMS,"  While parallel microchannel based cooling systems have been around for quite
a period of time, employing the same and incorporating them for near active
cooling of microelectronic devices is yet to be implemented and the
implications of the same on thermal mitigation to be understood. The present
article focusses on a specific design of the PMCS such that it can be
implemented at ease on the heat spreader of a modern microprocessor to obtain
near active cooling. Extensive experimental and numerical studies have been
carried out to comprehend the same and three different flow configurations of
PMCS have been adopted for the present investigations. Additional to focussing
on the thermofluidics due to flow configuration, nanofluids have also been
employed to achieve the desired essentials of mitigation of overshoot
temperatures and improving uniformity of cooling. Two modelling methods,
Discrete Phase Modelling and Effective Property Modelling have been employed
for numerical study to model nanofluids as working fluid in micro flow paths
and the DPM predictions have been observed to match accurately with
experiments. To quantify the thermal performance of PMCS, an appropriate Figure
of Merit has been proposed. From the FoM It has been perceived that the Z
configuration employing nanofluid is the best suitable solutions for uniform
thermal loads to achieve uniform cooling as well as reducing maximum
temperature produced with in the device. The present results are very promising
and viable approach for futuristic thermal mitigation of microprocessor
systems.
"
21107,A review of asymptotic theory of estimating functions,"  Asymptotic statistical theory for estimating functions is reviewed in a
generality suitable for stochastic processes. Conditions concerning existence
of a consistent estimator, uniqueness, rate of convergence, and the asymptotic
distribution are treated separately. Our conditions are not minimal, but can be
verified for many interesting stochastic process models. Several examples
illustrate the wide applicability of the theory and why the generality is
needed.
"
21108,Multiview Deep Learning for Predicting Twitter Users' Location,"  The problem of predicting the location of users on large social networks like
Twitter has emerged from real-life applications such as social unrest detection
and online marketing. Twitter user geolocation is a difficult and active
research topic with a vast literature. Most of the proposed methods follow
either a content-based or a network-based approach. The former exploits
user-generated content while the latter utilizes the connection or interaction
between Twitter users. In this paper, we introduce a novel method combining the
strength of both approaches. Concretely, we propose a multi-entry neural
network architecture named MENET leveraging the advances in deep learning and
multiview learning. The generalizability of MENET enables the integration of
multiple data representations. In the context of Twitter user geolocation, we
realize MENET with textual, network, and metadata features. Considering the
natural distribution of Twitter users across the concerned geographical area,
we subdivide the surface of the earth into multi-scale cells and train MENET
with the labels of the cells. We show that our method outperforms the state of
the art by a large margin on three benchmark datasets.
"
21109,"Designing the Optimal Bit: Balancing Energetic Cost, Speed and Reliability","  We consider the technologically relevant costs of operating a reliable bit
that can be erased rapidly. We find that both erasing and reliability times are
non-monotonic in the underlying friction, leading to a trade-off between
erasing speed and bit reliability. Fast erasure is possible at the expense of
low reliability at moderate friction, and high reliability comes at the expense
of slow erasure in the underdamped and overdamped limits. Within a given class
of bit parameters and control strategies, we define ""optimal"" designs of bits
that meet the desired reliability and erasing time requirements with the lowest
operational work cost. We find that optimal designs always saturate the bound
on the erasing time requirement, but can exceed the required reliability time
if critically damped. The non-trivial geometry of the reliability and erasing
time-scales allows us to exclude large regions of parameter space as
sub-optimal. We find that optimal designs are either critically damped or close
to critical damping under the erasing procedure.
"
21110,Economic Factors of Vulnerability Trade and Exploitation,"  Cybercrime markets support the development and diffusion of new attack
technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. Whereas the revenue streams
of cyber attackers have been studied multiple times in the literature, no
quantitative account currently exists on the economics of attack acquisition
and deployment. Yet, this understanding is critical to characterize the
production of (traded) exploits, the economy that drives it, and its effects on
the overall attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical
investigation of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the effects
of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected
first-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the trading of
the most active attack tools reported by the security industry happens. Our
findings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above
vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle
of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand,
cybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and
the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and
exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on
likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation
between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on
vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.
"
21111,Complete classification of generalized crossing changes between GOF-knots,"  We show that the monodromy for a genus one, fibered knot can have at most two
monodromy equivalence classes of once-unclean arcs. We use this to classify all
monodromies of genus one, fibered knots that possess once-unclean arcs, all
manifolds containing genus one fibered knots with generalized crossing changes
resulting in another genus one fibered knot, and all generalized crossing
changes between two genus one, fibered knots.
"
21112,Strain Mode of General Flow: Characterization and Implications for Flow Pattern Structures,"  Understanding the mixing capability of mixing devices based on their
geometric shape is an important issue both for predicting mixing processes and
for designing new mixers. The flow patterns in mixers are directly connected
with the modes of the local strain rate, which is generally a combination of
elongational flow and planar shear flow. We develop a measure to characterize
the modes of the strain rate for general flow occurring in mixers. The spatial
distribution of the volumetric strain rate (or non-planar strain rate) in
connection with the flow pattern plays an essential role in understanding
distributive mixing. With our measure, flows with different types of screw
elements in a twin-screw extruder are numerically analyzed. The difference in
flow pattern structure between conveying screws and kneading disks is
successfully characterized by the distribution of the volumetric strain rate.
The results suggest that the distribution of the strain rate mode offers an
essential and convenient way for characterization of the relation between flow
pattern structure and the mixer geometry.
"
21113,$\mathbb{Z}^2$-algebras as noncommutative blow-ups,"  The goal of this note is to first prove that for a well behaved
$\mathbb{Z}^2$-algebra $R$, the category $QGr(R) := Gr(R)/Tors(R)$ is
equivalent to $QGr(R_\Delta)$ where $R_\Delta$ is a diagonal-like
sub-$\mathbb{Z}$-algebra of $R$. Afterwards we use this result to prove that
the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-algebras as introduced in [arXiv:1607.08383] are
QGr-equivalent to a diagonal-like sub-$\mathbb{Z}$-algebra which is a
simultaneous noncommutative blow-up of a quadratic and a cubic Sklyanin
algebra. As such we link the noncommutative birational transformation and the
associated $\mathbb{Z}^2$-algebras as appearing in the work of Van den Bergh
and Presotto with the noncommutative blowups appearing in the work of Rogalski,
Sierra and Stafford.
"
21114,Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Anomaly Event Classification on Distributed Systems,"  The increasing popularity of server usage has brought a plenty of anomaly log
events, which have threatened a vast collection of machines. Recognizing and
categorizing the anomalous events thereby is a much salient work for our
systems, especially the ones generate the massive amount of data and harness it
for technology value creation and business development. To assist in focusing
on the classification and the prediction of anomaly events, and gaining
critical insights from system event records, we propose a novel log
preprocessing method which is very effective to filter abundant information and
retain critical characteristics. Additionally, a competitive approach for
automated classification of anomalous events detected from the distributed
system logs with the state-of-the-art deep (Convolutional Neural Network)
architectures is proposed in this paper. We measure a series of deep CNN
algorithms with varied hyper-parameter combinations by using standard
evaluation metrics, the results of our study reveals the advantages and
potential capabilities of the proposed deep CNN models for anomaly event
classification tasks on real-world systems. The optimal classification
precision of our approach is 98.14%, which surpasses the popular traditional
machine learning methods.
"
21115,Group-sparse block PCA and explained variance,"  The paper addresses the simultneous determination of goup-sparse loadings by
block optimization, and the correlated problem of defining explained variance
for a set of non orthogonal components. We give in both cases a comprehensive
mathematical presentation of the problem, which leads to propose i) a new
formulation/algorithm for group-sparse block PCA and ii) a framework for the
definition of explained variance with the analysis of five definitions. The
numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over
deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of
group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms
according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition of
explained variance. These results lead to propose a new optimal variance as the
definition of choice for explained variance.
"
21116,Multi-Frequency Phase Synchronization,"  We propose a novel formulation for phase synchronization -- the statistical
problem of jointly estimating alignment angles from noisy pairwise comparisons
-- as a nonconvex optimization problem that enforces consistency among the
pairwise comparisons in multiple frequency channels. Inspired by harmonic
retrieval in signal processing, we develop a simple yet efficient two-stage
algorithm that leverages the multi-frequency information. We demonstrate in
theory and practice that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art phase synchronization algorithms, at a mild computational
costs incurred by using the extra frequency channels. We also extend our
algorithmic framework to general synchronization problems over compact Lie
groups.
"
21117,A Bennequin-type inequality and combinatorial bounds,"  In this paper we provide a new Bennequin-type inequality for the Rasmussen-
Beliakova-Wehrli invariant, featuring the numerical transverse braid invariants
(the c-invariants) introduced by the author. From the Bennequin
type-inequality, and a combinatorial bound on the value of the c-invariants, we
deduce a new computable bound on the Rasmussen invariant.
"
21118,Thermal field theory of bosonic gases with finite-range effective interaction,"  We study a dilute and ultracold Bose gas of interacting atoms by using an
effective field theory which takes account finite-range effects of the
inter-atomic potential. Within the formalism of functional integration from the
grand canonical partition function we derive beyond-mean-field analytical
results which depend on both scattering length and effective range of the
interaction. In particular, we calculate the equation of state of the bosonic
system as a function of these interaction parameters both at zero and finite
temperature including one-loop Gaussian fluctuation. In the case of zero-range
effective interaction we explicitly show that, due to quantum fluctuations, the
bosonic system is thermodynamically stable only for very small values of the
gas parameter. We find that a positive effective range above a critical
threshold is necessary to remove the thermodynamical instability of the uniform
configuration. Remarkably, also for relatively large values of the gas
parameter, our finite-range results are in quite good agreement with recent
zero-temperature Monte Carlo calculations obtained with hard-sphere bosons.
"
21119,LtFi: Cross-technology Communication for RRM between LTE-U and IEEE 802.11,"  Cross-technology communication (CTC) was proposed in recent literature as a
way to exploit the opportunities of collaboration between heterogeneous
wireless technologies. This paper presents LtFi, a system which enables to
set-up a CTC between nodes of co-located LTE-U and WiFi networks. LtFi follows
a two-step approach: using the air-interface LTE-U BSs are broadcasting
connection and identification data to adjacent WiFi nodes, which is used to
create a bi-directional control channel over the wired Internet. This way LtFi
enables the development of advanced cross-technology interference and radio
resource management schemes between heterogeneous WiFi and LTE-U networks.
LtFi is of low complexity and fully compliant with LTE-U technology and works
on WiFi side with COTS hardware. It was prototypically implemented and
evaluated. Experimental results reveal that LtFi is able to reliably decoded
the data transmitted over the LtFi air-interface in a crowded wireless
environment at even very low LTE-U receive power levels of -92dBm. Moreover,
results from system-level simulations show that LtFi is able to accurately
estimate the set of interfering LTE-U BSs in a typical LTE-U multi-cell
environment.
"
21120,Multi-step Off-policy Learning Without Importance Sampling Ratios,"  To estimate the value functions of policies from exploratory data, most
model-free off-policy algorithms rely on importance sampling, where the use of
importance sampling ratios often leads to estimates with severe variance. It is
thus desirable to learn off-policy without using the ratios. However, such an
algorithm does not exist for multi-step learning with function approximation.
In this paper, we introduce the first such algorithm based on
temporal-difference (TD) learning updates. We show that an explicit use of
importance sampling ratios can be eliminated by varying the amount of
bootstrapping in TD updates in an action-dependent manner. Our new algorithm
achieves stability using a two-timescale gradient-based TD update. A prior
algorithm based on lookup table representation called Tree Backup can also be
retrieved using action-dependent bootstrapping, becoming a special case of our
algorithm. In two challenging off-policy tasks, we demonstrate that our
algorithm is stable, effectively avoids the large variance issue, and can
perform substantially better than its state-of-the-art counterpart.
"
21121,Atomic Ferris wheel beams,"  We study the generation of atom vortex beams in the case where an atomic
wave-packet, moving in free space, is diffracted from a properly tailored light
mask with a spiral transverse profile. We show how such a diffraction scheme
could lead to the production of an atomic Ferris wheel beam.
"
21122,On the Limits of Learning Representations with Label-Based Supervision,"  Advances in neural network based classifiers have transformed automatic
feature learning from a pipe dream of stronger AI to a routine and expected
property of practical systems. Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning
submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation
learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning,
representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from
supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as
supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable
representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be
powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned
from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their
supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an
information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for
representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions,
we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for
representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not. We hope that our analysis will
provide a rigorous motivation for further exploration of generative
representation learning.
"
21123,Coset space construction and inverse Higgs phenomenon for the conformal group,"  It is shown that conformally invariant theories can be obtained within the
framework of the coset space construction. The corresponding technique is
applicable for the construction of representations of the unbroken conformal
group, as well as of a spontaneously broken one. A special role of the
""Nambu-Goldstone fields"" for special conformal transformations is clarified -
they ensure self-consistency of a theory by guaranteeing that discrete
symmetries are indeed symmetries of the theory. A generalization of the
developed construction to a special class of symmetry groups with a non-linear
realization of its discrete elements is given. Based on these results, the
usage of the inverse Higgs constraints for the conformal group undergoing
spontaneous symmetry breaking is questioned.
"
21124,"A spatial predictive model for Malaria resurgence in central Greece integrating entomological, environmental and Social data","  Malaria constitutes an important cause of human mortality. After 2009 Greece
experienced a resurgence of malaria. Here, we develop a modelbased framework
that integrates entomological, geographical, social and environmental evidence
in order to guide the mosquito control efforts and apply this framework to data
from an entomological survey study conducted in Central Greece. Our results
indicate that malaria transmission risk in Greece is potentially substantial.
In addition, specific districts such as seaside, lakeside and rice field
regions appear to represent potential malaria hotspots in Central Greece. We
found that appropriate maps depicting the basic reproduction number, R0 , are
useful tools for informing policy makers on the risk of malaria resurgence and
can serve as a guide to inform recommendations regarding control measures.
"
21125,Large-scale analysis of user exposure to online advertising in Facebook,"  Online advertising is the major source of income for a large portion of
Internet Services. There exists a body of literature aiming at optimizing ads
engagement, understanding the privacy and ethical implications of online
advertising, etc. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work
analyses at large scale the exposure of real users to online advertising. This
paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the exposure of users to ads and
advertisers using a dataset including more than 7M ads from 140K unique
advertisers delivered to more than 5K users that was collected between October
2016 and May 2018. The study focuses on Facebook, which is the second largest
advertising platform only to Google in terms of revenue, and accounts for more
than 2.2B monthly active users. Our analysis reveals that Facebook users are
exposed (in median) to 70 ads per week, which come from 12 advertisers. Ads
represent between 10% and 15% of all the information received in users'
newsfeed. A small increment of 1% in the portion of ads in the newsfeed could
roughly represent a revenue increase of 8.17M USD per week for Facebook.
Finally, we also reveal that Facebook users are overprofiled since in the best
case only 22.76% of the interests Facebook assigns to users for advertising
purpose are actually related to the ads those users receive.
"
21126,Concept Formation and Dynamics of Repeated Inference in Deep Generative Models,"  Deep generative models are reported to be useful in broad applications
including image generation. Repeated inference between data space and latent
space in these models can denoise cluttered images and improve the quality of
inferred results. However, previous studies only qualitatively evaluated image
outputs in data space, and the mechanism behind the inference has not been
investigated. The purpose of the current study is to numerically analyze
changes in activity patterns of neurons in the latent space of a deep
generative model called a ""variational auto-encoder"" (VAE). What kinds of
inference dynamics the VAE demonstrates when noise is added to the input data
are identified. The VAE embeds a dataset with clear cluster structures in the
latent space and the center of each cluster of multiple correlated data points
(memories) is referred as the concept. Our study demonstrated that transient
dynamics of inference first approaches a concept, and then moves close to a
memory. Moreover, the VAE revealed that the inference dynamics approaches a
more abstract concept to the extent that the uncertainty of input data
increases due to noise. It was demonstrated that by increasing the number of
the latent variables, the trend of the inference dynamics to approach a concept
can be enhanced, and the generalization ability of the VAE can be improved.
"
21127,Lp-estimates for the square root of elliptic systems with mixed boundary conditions,"  This article focuses on Lp-estimates for the square root of elliptic systems
of second order in divergence form on a bounded domain. We treat complex
bounded measurable coefficients and allow for mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions on domains beyond the Lipschitz class. If there is an associated
bounded semigroup on Lp0 , then we prove that the square root extends for all p
$\in$ (p0, 2) to an isomorphism between a closed subspace of W1p carrying the
boundary conditions and Lp. This result is sharp and extrapolates to exponents
slightly above 2. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal p-interval for the
bounded H$\infty$-calculus on Lp. Estimates depend holomorphically on the
coefficients, thereby making them applicable to questions of non-autonomous
maximal regularity and optimal control. For completeness we also provide a
short summary on the Kato square root problem in L2 for systems with lower
order terms in our setting.
"
21128,Ensemble of Thermostatically Controlled Loads: Statistical Physics Approach,"  Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL), e.g. air-conditioners and heaters,
are by far the most wide-spread consumers of electricity. Normally the devices
are calibrated to provide the so-called bang-bang control of temperature --
changing from on to off, and vice versa, depending on temperature. Aggregation
of a large group of similar devices into a statistical ensemble is considered,
where the devices operate following the same dynamics subject to stochastic
perturbations and randomized, Poisson on/off switching policy. We analyze,
using theoretical and computational tools of statistical physics, how the
ensemble relaxes to a stationary distribution and establish relation between
the relaxation and statistics of the probability flux, associated with devices'
cycling in the mixed (discrete, switch on/off, and continuous, temperature)
phase space. This allowed us to derive and analyze spectrum of the
non-equilibrium (detailed balance broken) statistical system and uncover how
switching policy affects oscillatory trend and speed of the relaxation.
Relaxation of the ensemble is of a practical interest because it describes how
the ensemble recovers from significant perturbations, e.g. forceful temporary
switching off aimed at utilizing flexibility of the ensemble in providing
""demand response"" services relieving consumption temporarily to balance larger
power grid. We discuss how the statistical analysis can guide further
development of the emerging demand response technology.
"
21129,Automatic Document Image Binarization using Bayesian Optimization,"  Document image binarization is often a challenging task due to various forms
of degradation. Although there exist several binarization techniques in
literature, the binarized image is typically sensitive to control parameter
settings of the employed technique. This paper presents an automatic document
image binarization algorithm to segment the text from heavily degraded document
images. The proposed technique uses a two band-pass filtering approach for
background noise removal, and Bayesian optimization for automatic
hyperparameter selection for optimal results. The effectiveness of the proposed
binarization technique is empirically demonstrated on the Document Image
Binarization Competition (DIBCO) and the Handwritten Document Image
Binarization Competition (H-DIBCO) datasets.
"
21130,Vibrationally resolved electronic spectra including vibrational pre-excitation: Theory and application to VIPER spectroscopy,"  Vibrationally resolved electronic absorption spectra including the effect of
vibrational pre-excitation are computed in order to interpret and predict
vibronic transitions that are probed in the Vibrationally Promoted Electronic
Resonance (VIPER) experiment [L. J. G. W. van Wilderen et al., Angew. Chem.
Int. Ed. 53, 2667 (2014)]. To this end, we employ time-independent and
time-dependent methods based on the evaluation of Franck-Condon overlap
integrals and Fourier transformation of time-domain wavepacket autocorrelation
functions, respectively. The time-independent approach uses a generalized
version of the FCclasses method [F. Santoro et al., J. Chem. Phys. 126, 084509
(2007)]. In the time-dependent approach, autocorrelation functions are obtained
by wavepacket propagation and by evaluation of analytic expressions, within the
harmonic approximation including Duschinsky rotation effects. For several
medium-sized polyatomic systems, it is shown that selective pre-excitation of
particular vibrational modes leads to a red-shift of the low-frequency edge of
the electronic absorption spectrum, which is a prerequisite for the VIPER
experiment. This effect is typically most pronounced upon excitation of ring
distortion modes within an aromatic pi-system. Theoretical predictions as to
which modes show the strongest VIPER effect are found to be in excellent
agreement with experiment.
"
21131,Modular Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning with Decision Values,"  In this work we present a method for using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) in
multi-objective environments. Deep Q-Networks provide remarkable performance in
single objective problems learning from high-level visual state
representations. However, in many scenarios (e.g in robotics, games), the agent
needs to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously. We propose an architecture
in which separate DQNs are used to control the agent's behaviour with respect
to particular objectives. In this architecture we introduce decision values to
improve the scalarization of multiple DQNs into a single action. Our
architecture enables the decomposition of the agent's behaviour into
controllable and replaceable sub-behaviours learned by distinct modules.
Moreover, it allows to change the priorities of particular objectives
post-learning, while preserving the overall performance of the agent. To
evaluate our solution we used a game-like simulator in which an agent -
provided with high-level visual input - pursues multiple objectives in a 2D
world.
"
21132,Coupled conditional backward sampling particle filter,"  Unbiased estimation for hidden Markov models has been recently proposed by
Jacob et al (to appear), using a coupling of two conditional particle filters
(CPFs). Unbiased estimation has many advantages, such as enabling the
construction of asymptotically exact confidence intervals and straightforward
parallelisation. In this work we propose a new coupling of two CPFs, for
unbiased estimation, that uses backward sampling steps, which is an important
efficiency enhancing technique in particle filtering. We show that this coupled
conditional backward sampling particle filter (CCBPF) algorithm has better
stability properties, in the sense that with fixed number of particles, the
coupling time in terms of iterations increases only linearly with respect to
the time horizon under a general (strong mixing) condition. In contrast,
current coupled CPFs require the particle number to increase with the horizon
length. An important corollary of our results is a new quantitative bound for
the convergence rate of the popular backward sampling conditional particle
filter. Previous theoretical results have not been able to demonstrate the
improvement brought by backward sampling to the CPF, whereas we provide rates
showing that backward sampling ensures that the CPF can remain effective with a
fixed number of particles independent of the time horizon.
"
21133,A Bayesian Evidence Synthesis Approach to Estimate Disease Prevalence in Hard-To-Reach Populations: Hepatitis C in New York City,"  Existing methods to estimate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in
New York City (NYC) are limited in scope and fail to assess hard-to-reach
subpopulations with highest risk such as injecting drug users (IDUs). To
address these limitations, we employ a Bayesian multi-parameter evidence
synthesis model to systematically combine multiple sources of data, account for
bias in certain data sources, and provide unbiased HCV prevalence estimates
with associated uncertainty. Our approach improves on previous estimates by
explicitly accounting for injecting drug use and including data from high-risk
subpopulations such as the incarcerated, and is more inclusive, utilizing ten
NYC data sources. In addition, we derive two new equations to allow age at
first injecting drug use data for former and current IDUs to be incorporated
into the Bayesian evidence synthesis, a first for this type of model. Our
estimated overall HCV prevalence as of 2012 among NYC adults aged 20-59 years
is 2.78% (95% CI 2.61-2.94%), which represents between 124,900 and 140,000
chronic HCV cases. These estimates suggest that HCV prevalence in NYC is higher
than previously indicated from household surveys (2.2%) and the surveillance
system (2.37%), and that HCV transmission is increasing among young injecting
adults in NYC. An ancillary benefit from our results is an estimate of current

21134,"Galaxies in the Illustris simulation as seen by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - I: Bulge+disc decompositions, methods, and biases","  We present an image-based method for comparing the structural properties of
galaxies produced in hydrodynamical simulations to real galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. The key feature of our work is the introduction of
extensive observational realism, such as object crowding, noise and viewing
angle, to the synthetic images of simulated galaxies, so that they can be
fairly compared to real galaxy catalogs. We apply our methodology to the
dust-free synthetic image catalog of galaxies from the Illustris simulation at
$z=0$, which are then fit with bulge+disc models to obtain morphological
parameters. In this first paper in a series, we detail our methods, quantify
observational biases, and present publicly available bulge+disc decomposition
catalogs. We find that our bulge+disc decompositions are largely robust to the
observational biases that affect decompositions of real galaxies. However, we
identify a significant population of galaxies (roughly 30\% of the full sample)
in Illustris that are prone to internal segmentation, leading to systematically
reduced flux estimates by up to a factor of 6, smaller half-light radii by up
to a factor of $\sim$ 2, and generally erroneous bulge-to-total fractions of
(B/T)=0.
"
21135,PubTree: A Hierarchical Search Tool for the MEDLINE Database,"  Keeping track of the ever-increasing body of scientific literature is an
escalating challenge. We present PubTree a hierarchical search tool that
efficiently searches the PubMed/MEDLINE dataset based upon a decision tree
constructed using >26 million abstracts. The tool is implemented as a webpage,
where users are asked a series of eighteen questions to locate pertinent
articles. The implementation of this hierarchical search tool highlights issues
endemic with document retrieval. However, the construction of this tree
indicates that with future developments hierarchical search could become an
effective tool (or adjunct) in the mining of biological literature.
"
21136,Dimensional crossover and incipient quantum size effects in superconducting niobium nanofilms,"  Superconducting and normal state properties of sputtered Niobium nanofilms
have been systematically investigated, as a function of film thickness in a
d=9-90 nm range, on different substrates. The width of the
superconducting-to-normal transition for all films remained in few tens of mK,
thus remarkably narrow, confirming their high quality. We found that the
superconducting critical current density exhibits a pronounced maximum, three
times larger than its bulk value, for film thickness around 25 nm, marking the
3D-to-2D crossover. The extracted magnetic penetration depth shows a sizeable
enhancement for the thinnest films, aside the usual demagnetization effects.
Additional amplification effects of the superconducting properties have been
obtained in the case of sapphire substrates or squeezing the lateral size of
the nanofilms. For thickness close to 20 nm we also measured a doubled
perpendicular critical magnetic field compared to its saturation value for d>33
nm, indicating shortening of the correlation length and the formation of small
Cooper pairs in the condensate. Our data analysis evidences an exciting
interplay between quantum-size and proximity effects together with
strong-coupling effects and importance of disorder in the thinnest films,
locating the ones with optimally enhanced critical properties close to the
BCS-BEC crossover regime.
"
21137,Phase Diagram of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Generalised Hopfield Networks with Arbitrary Priors,"  Restricted Boltzmann Machines are described by the Gibbs measure of a
bipartite spin glass, which in turn corresponds to the one of a generalised
Hopfield network. This equivalence allows us to characterise the state of these
systems in terms of retrieval capabilities, both at low and high load. We study
the paramagnetic-spin glass and the spin glass-retrieval phase transitions, as
the pattern (i.e. weight) distribution and spin (i.e. unit) priors vary
smoothly from Gaussian real variables to Boolean discrete variables. Our
analysis shows that the presence of a retrieval phase is robust and not
peculiar to the standard Hopfield model with Boolean patterns. The retrieval
region is larger when the pattern entries and retrieval units get more peaked
and, conversely, when the hidden units acquire a broader prior and therefore
have a stronger response to high fields. Moreover, at low load retrieval always
exists below some critical temperature, for every pattern distribution ranging
from the Boolean to the Gaussian case.
"
21138,Causal nearest neighbor rules for optimal treatment regimes,"  The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to
precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor
method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the
framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects
within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses
nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor
regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor
regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size
increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal
$k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e.
performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this
problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform
metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the
proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a
chronic depression clinical trial.
"
21139,Definitions of solutions to the IBVP for multiD scalar balance laws,"  We consider four definitions of solution to the initial-boundary value
problem for a scalar balance laws in several space dimensions. These
definitions are generalised to the same most general framework and then
compared. The first aim of this paper is to detail differences and analogies
among them. We focus then on the ways the boundary conditions are fulfilled
according to each definition, providing also connections among these various
modes. The main result is the proof of the equivalence among the presented
definitions of solution.
"
21140,Post-selection estimation and testing following aggregated association tests,"  The practice of pooling several individual test statistics to form aggregate
tests is common in many statistical application where individual tests may be
underpowered. While selection by aggregate tests can serve to increase power,
the selection process invalidates the individual test-statistics, making it
difficult to identify the ones that drive the signal in follow-up inference.
Here, we develop a general approach for valid inference following selection by
aggregate testing. We present novel powerful post-selection tests for the
individual null hypotheses which are exact for the normal model and
asymptotically justified otherwise. Our approach relies on the ability to
characterize the distribution of the individual test statistics after
conditioning on the event of selection. We provide efficient algorithms for
estimation of the post-selection maximum-likelihood estimates and suggest
confidence intervals which rely on a novel switching regime for good coverage
guarantees. We validate our methods via comprehensive simulation studies and
apply them to data from the Dallas Heart Study, demonstrating that single
variant association discovery following selection by an aggregated test is
indeed possible in practice.
"
21141,GANs for Medical Image Analysis,"  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their extensions have carved open
many exciting ways to tackle well known and challenging medical image analysis
problems such as medical image de-noising, reconstruction, segmentation, data
simulation, detection or classification. Furthermore, their ability to
synthesize images at unprecedented levels of realism also gives hope that the
chronic scarcity of labeled data in the medical field can be resolved with the
help of these generative models. In this review paper, a broad overview of
recent literature on GANs for medical applications is given, the shortcomings
and opportunities of the proposed methods are thoroughly discussed and
potential future work is elaborated. We review the most relevant papers
published until the submission date. For quick access, important details such
as the underlying method, datasets and performance are tabulated. An
interactive visualization categorizes all papers to keep the review alive.
"
21142,NFL Injuries Before and After the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA),"  The National Football League's (NFL) 2011 collective bargaining agreement
(CBA) with its players placed a number of contact and quantity limitations on
practices and workouts. Some coaches and others have expressed a concern that
this has led to poor conditioning and a subsequent increase in injuries. We
sought to assess whether the 2011 CBA's practice restrictions affected the
number of overall, conditioning-dependent, and/or non-conditioning-dependent
injuries in the NFL or the number of games missed due to those injuries. The
study population was player-seasons from 2007-2016. We included regular season,
non-illness, non-head, game-loss injuries. Injuries were identified using a
database from Football Outsiders. The primary outcomes were overall,
conditioning-dependent and non-conditioning-dependent injury counts by season.
We examined time trends in injury counts before (2007-2010) and after
(2011-2016) the CBA using a Poisson interrupted time series model. The number
of game-loss regular season, non-head, non-illness injuries grew from 701 in
2007 to 804 in 2016 (15% increase). The number of regular season weeks missed
exhibited a similar increase. Conditioning-dependent injuries increased from
197 in 2007 to 271 in 2011 (38% rise), but were lower and remained relatively
unchanged at 220-240 injuries per season thereafter. Non-conditioning injuries
decreased by 37% in the first three years of the new CBA before returning to
historic levels in 2014-2016. Poisson models for all, conditioning-dependent,
and non-conditioning-dependent game-loss injury counts did not show
statistically significant or meaningful detrimental changes associated with the
CBA. We did not observe an increase in injuries following the 2011 CBA. Other
concurrent injury-related rule and regulation changes limit specific causal
inferences about the practice restrictions, however.
"
21143,"Structured and Unstructured Outlier Identification for Robust PCA: A Non iterative, Parameter free Algorithm","  Robust PCA, the problem of PCA in the presence of outliers has been
extensively investigated in the last few years. Here we focus on Robust PCA in
the outlier model where each column of the data matrix is either an inlier or
an outlier. Most of the existing methods for this model assumes either the
knowledge of the dimension of the lower dimensional subspace or the fraction of
outliers in the system. However in many applications knowledge of these
parameters is not available. Motivated by this we propose a parameter free
outlier identification method for robust PCA which a) does not require the
knowledge of outlier fraction, b) does not require the knowledge of the
dimension of the underlying subspace, c) is computationally simple and fast d)
can handle structured and unstructured outliers. Further, analytical guarantees
are derived for outlier identification and the performance of the algorithm is
compared with the existing state of the art methods in both real and synthetic
data for various outlier structures.
"
21144,Foveated Video Streaming for Cloud Gaming,"  Good user experience with interactive cloud-based multimedia applications,
such as cloud gaming and cloud-based VR, requires low end-to-end latency and
large amounts of downstream network bandwidth at the same time. In this paper,
we present a foveated video streaming system for cloud gaming. The system
adapts video stream quality by adjusting the encoding parameters on the fly to
match the player's gaze position. We conduct measurements with a prototype that
we developed for a cloud gaming system in conjunction with eye tracker
hardware. Evaluation results suggest that such foveated streaming can reduce
bandwidth requirements by even more than 50% depending on parametrization of
the foveated video coding and that it is feasible from the latency perspective.
"
21145,Data-driven Analysis of Complex Networks and their Model-generated Counterparts,"  Data-driven analysis of complex networks has been in the focus of research
for decades. An important question is to discover the relation between various
network characteristics in real-world networks and how these relationships vary
across network domains. A related research question is to study how well the
network models can capture the observed relations between the graph metrics. In
this paper, we apply statistical and machine learning techniques to answer the
aforementioned questions. We study 400 real-world networks along with 2400
networks generated by five frequently used network models with previously
fitted parameters to make the generated graphs as similar to the real network
as possible. We find that the correlation profiles of the structural measures
significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be efficiently
determined using a small selection of graph metrics. The goodness-of-fit of the
network models and the best performing models themselves highly depend on the
domains. Using machine learning techniques, it turned out to be relatively easy
to decide if a network is real or model-generated. We also investigate what
structural properties make it possible to achieve a good accuracy, i.e. what
features the network models cannot capture.
"
21146,A Short Note on Collecting Dependently Typed Values,"  Within dependently typed languages, such as Idris, types can depend on
values. This dependency, however, can limit the collection of items in standard
containers: all elements must have the same type, and as such their types must
contain the same values. We present two dependently typed data structures for
collecting dependent types: \texttt{DList} and \texttt{PList}. Use of these new
data structures allow for the creation of single succinct inductive ADT whose
constructions were previously verbose and split across many data structures.
"
21147,Dynamic Bridge-Finding in $\tilde{O}(\log ^2 n)$ Amortized Time,"  We present a deterministic fully-dynamic data structure for maintaining
information about the bridges in a graph. We support updates in
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^2)$ amortized time, and can find a bridge in the component
of any given vertex, or a bridge separating any two given vertices, in $O(\log
n / \log \log n)$ worst case time. Our bounds match the current best for bounds
for deterministic fully-dynamic connectivity up to $\log\log n$ factors. The
previous best dynamic bridge finding was an $\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$ amortized
time algorithm by Thorup [STOC2000], which was a bittrick-based improvement on
the $O((\log n)^4)$ amortized time algorithm by Holm et al.[STOC98, JACM2001].
Our approach is based on a different and purely combinatorial improvement of
the algorithm of Holm et al., which by itself gives a new combinatorial
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$ amortized time algorithm. Combining it with Thorup's
bittrick, we get down to the claimed $\tilde{O}((\log n)^2)$ amortized time.
Essentially the same new trick can be applied to the biconnectivity data
structure from [STOC98, JACM2001], improving the amortized update time to
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$.
We also offer improvements in space. We describe a general trick which
applies to both of our new algorithms, and to the old ones, to get down to
linear space, where the previous best use $O(m + n\log n\log\log n)$. Finally,
we show how to obtain $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ query time, matching the optimal
trade-off between update and query time.
Our result yields an improved running time for deciding whether a unique
perfect matching exists in a static graph.
"
21148,Decomposition of Uncertainty in Bayesian Deep Learning for Efficient and Risk-sensitive Learning,"  Bayesian neural networks with latent variables are scalable and flexible
probabilistic models: They account for uncertainty in the estimation of the
network weights and, by making use of latent variables, can capture complex
noise patterns in the data. We show how to extract and decompose uncertainty
into epistemic and aleatoric components for decision-making purposes. This
allows us to successfully identify informative points for active learning of
functions with heteroscedastic and bimodal noise. Using the decomposition we
further define a novel risk-sensitive criterion for reinforcement learning to
identify policies that balance expected cost, model-bias and noise aversion.
"
21149,Standard errors for regression on relational data with exchangeable errors,"  Relational arrays represent interactions or associations between pairs of
actors, often in varied contexts or over time. Such data appear as, for
example, trade flows between countries, financial transactions between
individuals, contact frequencies between school children in classrooms, and
dynamic protein-protein interactions. This paper proposes and evaluates a new
class of parameter standard errors for models that represent elements of a
relational array as a linear function of observable covariates. Uncertainty
estimates for regression coefficients must account for both heterogeneity
across actors and dependence arising from relations involving the same actor.
Existing estimators of parameter standard errors that recognize such relational
dependence rely on estimating extremely complex, heterogeneous structure across
actors. Leveraging an exchangeability assumption, we derive parsimonious
standard error estimators that pool information across actors and are
substantially more accurate than existing estimators in a variety of settings.
This exchangeability assumption is pervasive in network and array models in the
statistics literature, but not previously considered when adjusting for
dependence in a regression setting with relational data. We show that our
estimator is consistent and demonstrate improvements in inference through
simulation and a data set involving international trade.
"
21150,Calculating normal tissue complication probabilities and probabilities of complication-free tumour control from stochastic models of population dynamics,"  We use a stochastic birth-death model for a population of cells to estimate
the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) under a particular
radiotherapy protocol. We specifically allow for interaction between cells, via
a nonlinear logistic growth model. To capture some of the effects of intrinsic
noise in the population we develop several approximations of NTCP, using
Kramers-Moyal expansion techniques. These approaches provide an approximation
to the first and second moments of a general first-passage time problem in the
limit of large, but finite populations. We use this method to study NTCP in a
simple model of normal cells and in a model of normal and damaged cells. We
also study a combined model of normal tissue cells and tumour cells. Based on
existing methods to calculate tumour control probabilities, and our procedure
to approximate NTCP, we estimate the probability of complication free tumour
control.
"
21151,Pathwise Derivatives Beyond the Reparameterization Trick,"  We observe that gradients computed via the reparameterization trick are in
direct correspondence with solutions of the transport equation in the formalism
of optimal transport. We use this perspective to compute (approximate) pathwise
gradients for probability distributions not directly amenable to the
reparameterization trick: Gamma, Beta, and Dirichlet. We further observe that
when the reparameterization trick is applied to the Cholesky-factorized
multivariate Normal distribution, the resulting gradients are suboptimal in the
sense of optimal transport. We derive the optimal gradients and show that they
have reduced variance in a Gaussian Process regression task. We demonstrate
with a variety of synthetic experiments and stochastic variational inference
tasks that our pathwise gradients are competitive with other methods.
"
21152,Network-size independent covering number bounds for deep networks,"  We give a covering number bound for deep learning networks that is
independent of the size of the network. The key for the simple analysis is that
for linear classifiers, rotating the data doesn't affect the covering number.
Thus, we can ignore the rotation part of each layer's linear transformation,
and get the covering number bound by concentrating on the scaling part.
"
21153,NIF: A Framework for Quantifying Neural Information Flow in Deep Networks,"  In this paper, we present a new approach to interpreting deep learning
models. More precisely, by coupling mutual information with network science, we
explore how information flows through feed forward networks. We show that
efficiently approximating mutual information via the dual representation of
Kullback-Leibler divergence allows us to create an information measure that
quantifies how much information flows between any two neurons of a deep
learning model. To that end, we propose NIF, Neural Information Flow, a new
metric for codifying information flow which exposes the internals of a deep
learning model while providing feature attributions.
"
21154,On functions given by algebraic power series over Henselian valued fields,"  This paper provides, over Henselian valued fields, some theorems on implicit
function and of Artin--Mazur on algebraic power series. Also discussed are
certain versions of the theorems of Abhyankar--Jung and Newton--Puiseux. The
latter is used in analysis of functions of one variable, definable in the
language of Denef--Pas, to obtain a theorem on existence of the limit, proven
over rank one valued fields in one of our recent papers. This result along with
the technique of fiber shrinking (developed there over rank one valued fields)
were, in turn, two basic tools in the proof of the closedness theorem.
"
21155,What can one learn about material structure given a single first-principles calculation?,"  We extract a variable $X$ from electron orbitals $\Psi_{n\bf{k}}$ and
energies $E_{n\bf{k}}$ in the parent high-symmetry structure of a wide range of
complex oxides: perovskites, rutiles, pyrochlores, and cristobalites. Even
though calculation was done only in the parent structure, with no distortions,
we show that $X$ dictates material's true ground state structure. We propose
using Wannier functions to extract concealed variables such as $X$ both for
material structure prediction and for high-throughput approaches.
"
21156,xUnit: Learning a Spatial Activation Function for Efficient Image Restoration,"  In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) achieved unprecedented
performance in many low-level vision tasks. However, state-of-the-art results
are typically achieved by very deep networks, which can reach tens of layers
with tens of millions of parameters. To make DNNs implementable on platforms
with limited resources, it is necessary to weaken the tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new activation unit,
which is particularly suitable for image restoration problems. In contrast to
the widespread per-pixel activation units, like ReLUs and sigmoids, our unit
implements a learnable nonlinear function with spatial connections. This
enables the net to capture much more complex features, thus requiring a
significantly smaller number of layers in order to reach the same performance.
We illustrate the effectiveness of our units through experiments with
state-of-the-art nets for denoising, de-raining, and super resolution, which
are already considered to be very small. With our approach, we are able to
further reduce these models by nearly 50% without incurring any degradation in
performance.
"
21157,"Multiwavelength study of VHE emission from Markarian 501 using TACTIC observations during April-May, 2012","  We have observed Markarian 501 in Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray wavelength
band for 70.6 hours from 15 April to 30 May, 2012 using TACTIC telescope.
Detailed analysis of $\sim$66.3 hours of clean data revealed the presence of a
TeV $\gamma$-ray signal (686$\pm$77 $\gamma$-ray events) from the source
direction with a statistical significance of 8.89$\sigma$ above 850 GeV.
Further, a total of 375 $\pm$ 47 $\gamma$-ray like events were detected in 25.2
hours of observation from 22 - 27 May, 2012 with a statistical significance of
8.05$\sigma$ indicating that the source has possibly switched over to a
relatively high gamma-ray emission state. We have derived time-averaged
differential energy spectrum of the state in the energy range 850 GeV - 17.24
TeV which fits well with a power law function of the form
$dF/dE=f_{0}E^{-\Gamma}$ with $f_{0}= (2.27 \pm 0.38) \times 10 ^{-11} $
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ and $\Gamma=2.57 \pm 0.15$. In order to
investigate the source state, we have also used almost simultaneous
multiwavelength observations viz: high energy data collected by
$\it{Fermi}$-LAT, X-ray data collected by $\it{Swift}$-XRT and MAXI, optical
and UV data collected by $\it{Swift}$-UVOT, and radio data collected by OVRO,
and reconstructed broad-band Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). The obtained
SED supports leptonic model (homogeneous single zone) for VHE gamma-ray
emission involving synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton (SSC) processes.
"
21158,"Sparsity enforcing priors in inverse problems via Normal variance mixtures: model selection, algorithms and applications","  The sparse structure of the solution for an inverse problem can be modelled
using different sparsity enforcing priors when the Bayesian approach is
considered. Analytical expression for the unknowns of the model can be obtained
by building hierarchical models based on sparsity enforcing distributions
expressed via conjugate priors. We consider heavy tailed distributions with
this property: the Student-t distribution, which is expressed as a Normal scale
mixture, with the mixing distribution the Inverse Gamma distribution, the
Laplace distribution, which can also be expressed as a Normal scale mixture,
with the mixing distribution the Exponential distribution or can be expressed
as a Normal inverse scale mixture, with the mixing distribution the Inverse
Gamma distribution, the Hyperbolic distribution, the Variance-Gamma
distribution, the Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution, all three expressed via
conjugate distributions using the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution. For all
distributions iterative algorithms are derived based on hierarchical models
that account for the uncertainties of the forward model. For estimation,
Maximum A Posterior (MAP) and Posterior Mean (PM) via variational Bayesian
approximation (VBA) are used. The performances of resulting algorithm are
compared in applications in 3D computed tomography (3D-CT) and chronobiology.
Finally, a theoretical study is developed for comparison between sparsity
enforcing algorithms obtained via the Bayesian approach and the sparsity
enforcing algorithms issued from regularization techniques, like LASSO and some
others.
"
21159,Learning Koopman Invariant Subspaces for Dynamic Mode Decomposition,"  Spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator is attracting attention as a
tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Dynamic mode
decomposition is a popular numerical algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis;
however, we often need to prepare nonlinear observables manually according to
the underlying dynamics, which is not always possible since we may not have any
a priori knowledge about them. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven
method for Koopman spectral analysis based on the principle of learning Koopman
invariant subspaces from observed data. To this end, we propose minimization of
the residual sum of squares of linear least-squares regression to estimate a
set of functions that transforms data into a form in which the linear
regression fits well. We introduce an implementation with neural networks and
evaluate performance empirically using nonlinear dynamical systems and
applications.
"
21160,Structure and Content of the Visible Darknet,"  In this paper, we analyze the topology and the content found on the
""darknet"", the set of websites accessible via Tor. We created a darknet spider
and crawled the darknet starting from a bootstrap list by recursively following
links. We explored the whole connected component of more than 34,000 hidden
services, of which we found 10,000 to be online. Contrary to folklore belief,
the visible part of the darknet is surprisingly well-connected through hub
websites such as wikis and forums. We performed a comprehensive categorization
of the content using supervised machine learning. We observe that about half of
the visible dark web content is related to apparently licit activities based on
our classifier. A significant amount of content pertains to software
repositories, blogs, and activism-related websites. Among unlawful hidden
services, most pertain to fraudulent websites, services selling counterfeit
goods, and drug markets.
"
21161,Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of heterogeneous tissue curvature: A suggestion for role of left atrial appendage in atrial fibrillation,"  Background: The arrhythmogenic role of atrial complex morphology has not yet
been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that bumpy tissue geometry can induce
action potential duration (APD) dispersion and wavebreak in atrial fibrillation
(AF).
Methods and Results: We simulated 2D-bumpy atrial model by varying the degree
of bumpiness, and 3D-left atrial (LA) models integrated by LA computed
tomographic (CT) images taken from 14 patients with persistent AF. We also
analyzed wave-dynamic parameters with bipolar electrograms during AF and
compared them with LA-CT geometry in 30 patients with persistent AF. In
2D-bumpy model, APD dispersion increased (p<0.001) and wavebreak occurred
spontaneously when the surface bumpiness was higher, showing phase
transition-like behavior (p<0.001). Bumpiness gradient 2D-model showed that
spiral wave drifted in the direction of higher bumpiness, and phase singularity
(PS) points were mostly located in areas with higher bumpiness. In 3D-LA model,
PS density was higher in LA appendage (LAA) compared to other LA parts
(p<0.05). In 30 persistent AF patients, the surface bumpiness of LAA was
5.8-times that of other LA parts (p<0.001), and exceeded critical bumpiness to
induce wavebreak. Wave dynamics complexity parameters were consistently
dominant in LAA (p<0.001).
Conclusion: The bumpy tissue geometry promotes APD dispersion, wavebreak, and
spiral wave drift in in silico human atrial tissue, and corresponds to clinical
electro-anatomical maps.
"
21162,Fragmentation of phase-fluctuating condensates,"  We study zero-temperature quantum phase fluctuations in harmonically trapped
one-dimensional interacting Bose gases, using the self-consistent
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method. In a regime of mesoscopic
particle numbers and moderate contact couplings, it is shown that the
phase-fluctuating condensate is properly described as a fragmented condensate.
In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the amplitude of
phase fluctuations significantly deviates from what is obtained in Bogoliubov
theory. Our results can be verified in currently available experiments. They
therefore provide an opportunity both to experimentally benchmark the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, as well as to directly
observe, for the first time, the quantum many-body phenomenon of fragmentation
in single traps.
"
21163,Thermoelectric transport parallel to the planes in a multilayered Mott-Hubbard heterostructure,"  We present a theory for charge and heat transport parallel to the interfaces
of a multilayer (ML) in which the interfacing gives rise the redistribution of
the electronic charges. The ensuing electrical field couples self-consistently
to the itinerant electrons, so that the properties of the ML crucially depend
on an interplay between the on-site Coulomb forces and the long range
electrostatic forces. The ML is described by the Falicov-Kimball model and the
self-consistent solution is obtained by iterating simultaneously the DMFT and
the Poisson equations. This yields the reconstructed charge profile, the
electrical potential, the planar density of states, the transport function, and
the transport coefficients of the device.
We find that a heterostructure built of two Mott-Hubbard insulators exhibits,
in a large temperature interval, a linear conductivity and a large
temperature-independent thermopower. The charge and energy currents are
confined to the central part of the ML. Our results indicate that correlated
multilayers have the potential for applications; by tuning the band shift and
the Coulomb correlation on the central planes, we can bring the chemical
potential in the immediate proximity of the Mott-Hubbard gap edge and optimize
the transport properties of the device. In such a heterostructure, a small gate
voltage can easily induce a MI transition. This switching does not involve the
diffusion of electrons over macroscopic distances and it is much faster than in
ordinary semiconductors. Furthermore, the right combination of strongly
correlated materials with small ZT can produce, theoretically at least, a
heterostructure with a large ZT.
"
21164,Mining Device-Specific Apps Usage Patterns from Large-Scale Android Users,"  When smartphones, applications (a.k.a, apps), and app stores have been widely
adopted by the billions, an interesting debate emerges: whether and to what
extent do device models influence the behaviors of their users? The answer to
this question is critical to almost every stakeholder in the smartphone app
ecosystem, including app store operators, developers, end-users, and network
providers. To approach this question, we collect a longitudinal data set of app
usage through a leading Android app store in China, called Wandoujia. The data
set covers the detailed behavioral profiles of 0.7 million (761,262) unique
users who use 500 popular types of Android devices and about 0.2 million
(228,144) apps, including their app management activities, daily network access
time, and network traffic of apps. We present a comprehensive study on
investigating how the choices of device models affect user behaviors such as
the adoption of app stores, app selection and abandonment, data plan usage,
online time length, the tendency to use paid/free apps, and the preferences to
choosing competing apps. Some significant correlations between device models
and app usage are derived, leading to important findings on the various user
behaviors. For example, users owning different device models have a substantial
diversity of selecting competing apps, and users owning lower-end devices spend
more money to purchase apps and spend more time under cellular network.
"
21165,Homotopical Stable Ranks for Certain C*-algebras,"  We study the general and connected stable ranks for C*-algebras. We estimate
these ranks for pullbacks of C*-algebras, and for tensor products by
commutative C*-algebras. Finally, we apply these results to determine these
ranks for certain commutative C*-algebras, and non-commutative CW-complexes.

21166,Covariantly functorial wrapped Floer theory on Liouville sectors,"  We introduce a class of Liouville manifolds with boundary which we call
Liouville sectors. We define the wrapped Fukaya category, symplectic
cohomology, and the open-closed map for Liouville sectors, and we show that
these invariants are covariantly functorial with respect to inclusions of
Liouville sectors. From this foundational setup, a local-to-global principle
for Abouzaid's generation criterion follows.
"
21167,Robust Sparse Covariance Estimation by Thresholding Tyler's M-Estimator,"  Estimating a high-dimensional sparse covariance matrix from a limited number
of samples is a fundamental problem in contemporary data analysis. Most
proposals to date, however, are not robust to outliers or heavy tails. Towards
bridging this gap, in this work we consider estimating a sparse shape matrix
from $n$ samples following a possibly heavy tailed elliptical distribution. We
propose estimators based on thresholding either Tyler's M-estimator or its
regularized variant. We derive bounds on the difference in spectral norm
between our estimators and the shape matrix in the joint limit as the dimension
$p$ and sample size $n$ tend to infinity with $p/n\to\gamma>0$. These bounds
are minimax rate-optimal. Results on simulated data support our theoretical
analysis.
"
21168,Human Perceptions of Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making: A Case Study of Criminal Risk Prediction,"  As algorithms are increasingly used to make important decisions that affect
human lives, ranging from social benefit assignment to predicting risk of
criminal recidivism, concerns have been raised about the fairness of
algorithmic decision making. Most prior works on algorithmic fairness
normatively prescribe how fair decisions ought to be made. In contrast, here,
we descriptively survey users for how they perceive and reason about fairness
in algorithmic decision making.
A key contribution of this work is the framework we propose to understand why
people perceive certain features as fair or unfair to be used in algorithms.
Our framework identifies eight properties of features, such as relevance,
volitionality and reliability, as latent considerations that inform people's
moral judgments about the fairness of feature use in decision-making
algorithms. We validate our framework through a series of scenario-based
surveys with 576 people. We find that, based on a person's assessment of the
eight latent properties of a feature in our exemplar scenario, we can
accurately (> 85%) predict if the person will judge the use of the feature as
fair.
Our findings have important implications. At a high-level, we show that
people's unfairness concerns are multi-dimensional and argue that future
studies need to address unfairness concerns beyond discrimination. At a
low-level, we find considerable disagreements in people's fairness judgments.
We identify root causes of the disagreements, and note possible pathways to
resolve them.
"
21169,Genetic Algorithm Based Floor Planning System,"  Genetic Algorithms are widely used in many different optimization problems
including layout design. The layout of the shelves play an important role in
the total sales metrics for superstores since this affects the customers'
shopping behaviour. This paper employed a genetic algorithm based approach to
design shelf layout of superstores. The layout design problem was tackled by
using a novel chromosome representation which takes many different parameters
to prevent dead-ends and improve shelf visibility into consideration. Results
show that the approach can produce reasonably good layout designs in very short
amounts of time.

21170,"On SDEs with Lipschitz coefficients, driven by continuous, model-free price paths","  Using similar assumptions as in Revuz and Yor's book we prove the existence
and uniqueness of the solutions of SDEs with Lipschitz coefficients, driven by
continuous, model-free price paths. The main tool in our reasonings is a
model-free version of the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality for integrals
driven by model-free, continuous price paths.
"
21171,Stability of receding traveling waves for a fourth order degenerate parabolic free boundary problem,"  Consider the thin-film equation $h_t + \left(h h_{yyy}\right)_y = 0$ with a
zero contact angle at the free boundary, that is, at the triple junction where
liquid, gas, and solid meet. Previous results on stability and well-posedness
of this equation have focused on perturbations of equilibrium-stationary or
self-similar profiles, the latter eventually wetting the whole surface. These
solutions have their counterparts for the second-order porous-medium equation
$h_t - (h^m)_{yy} = 0$, where $m > 1$ is a free parameter. Both porous-medium
and thin-film equation degenerate as $h \searrow 0$, but the porous-medium
equation additionally fulfills a comparison principle while the thin-film
equation does not.
In this note, we consider traveling waves $h = \frac V 6 x^3 + \nu x^2$ for
$x \ge 0$, where $x = y-V t$ and $V, \nu \ge 0$ are free parameters. These
traveling waves are receding and therefore describe de-wetting, a phenomenon
genuinely linked to the fourth-order nature of the thin-film equation and not
encountered in the porous-medium case as it violates the comparison principle.
The linear stability analysis leads to a linear fourth-order
degenerate-parabolic operator for which we prove maximal-regularity estimates
to arbitrary orders of the expansion in $x$ in a right-neighborhood of the
contact line $x = 0$. This leads to a well-posedness and stability result for
the corresponding nonlinear equation. As the linearized evolution has different
scaling as $x \searrow 0$ and $x \to \infty$, the analysis is more intricate
than in related previous works. We anticipate that our approach is a natural
step towards investigating other situations in which the comparison principle
is violated, such as droplet rupture.
"
21172,Group Importance Sampling for Particle Filtering and MCMC,"  Bayesian methods and their implementations by means of sophisticated Monte
Carlo techniques have become very popular in signal processing over the last
years. Importance Sampling (IS) is a well-known Monte Carlo technique that
approximates integrals involving a posterior distribution by means of weighted
samples. In this work, we study the assignation of a single weighted sample
which compresses the information contained in a population of weighted samples.
Part of the theory that we present as Group Importance Sampling (GIS) has been
employed implicitly in different works in the literature. The provided analysis
yields several theoretical and practical consequences. For instance, we discuss
the application of GIS into the Sequential Importance Resampling framework and
show that Independent Multiple Try Metropolis schemes can be interpreted as a
standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, following the GIS approach. We also
introduce two novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques based on GIS.
The first one, named Group Metropolis Sampling method, produces a Markov chain
of sets of weighted samples. All these sets are then employed for obtaining a
unique global estimator. The second one is the Distributed Particle
Metropolis-Hastings technique, where different parallel particle filters are
jointly used to drive an MCMC algorithm. Different resampled trajectories are
compared and then tested with a proper acceptance probability. The novel
schemes are tested in different numerical experiments such as learning the
hyperparameters of Gaussian Processes, two localization problems in a wireless
sensor network (with synthetic and real data) and the tracking of vegetation
parameters given satellite observations, where they are compared with several
benchmark Monte Carlo techniques. Three illustrative Matlab demos are also
provided.
"
21173,Double Temporal Sparsity Based Accelerated Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing fMRI,"  A number of reconstruction methods have been proposed recently for
accelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data collection.
However, existing methods suffer with the challenge of greater artifacts at
high acceleration factors. This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI
collection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed
Double Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method with the l1 -l1
norm constraint. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly
evaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data.
Results are presented at various acceleration factors. Quantitative analysis in
terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative
analysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs)
demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the
proposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying
fMRI data. Compared to the existing accelerated fMRI reconstruction methods,
the DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10-12dB in
PSNR with acceleration factors upto 3.5. Simulation results on real data
demonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with
accurate detection of RSNs.
"
21174,A continuum model for distributions of dislocations incorporating short-range interactions,"  Dislocations are the main carriers of the permanent deformation of crystals.
For simulations of engineering applications, continuum models where material
microstructures are represented by continuous density distributions of
dislocations are preferred. It is challenging to capture in the continuum model
the short-range dislocation interactions, which vanish after the standard
averaging procedure from discrete dislocation models. In this study, we
consider systems of parallel straight dislocation walls and develop continuum
descriptions for the short-range interactions of dislocations by using
asymptotic analysis. The obtained continuum short-range interaction formulas
are incorporated in the continuum model for dislocation dynamics based on a
pair of dislocation density potential functions that represent continuous
distributions of dislocations. This derived continuum model is able to describe
the anisotropic dislocation interaction and motion. Mathematically, these
short-range interaction terms ensure strong stability property of the continuum
model that is possessed by the discrete dislocation dynamics model. The derived
continuum model is validated by comparisons with the discrete dislocation
dynamical simulation results.
"
21175,Phase transition and power-law coarsening in Ising-doped voter model,"  We examine an opinion formation model, which is a mixture of Voter and Ising
agents. Numerical simulations show that even a very small fraction ($\sim 1\%$)
of the Ising agents drastically changes the behaviour of the Voter model. The
Voter agents act as a medium, which correlates sparsely dispersed Ising agents,
and the resulting ferromagnetic ordering persists up to a certain temperature.
Upon addition of the Ising agents, a logarithmically slow coarsening of the
Voter model ($d=2$), or its active steady state ($d=3$), change into an
Ising-type power-law coarsening.
"
21176,A probabilistic data-driven model for planar pushing,"  This paper presents a data-driven approach to model planar pushing
interaction to predict both the most likely outcome of a push and its expected
variability. The learned models rely on a variation of Gaussian processes with
input-dependent noise called Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian processes
(VHGP) that capture the mean and variance of a stochastic function. We show
that we can learn accurate models that outperform analytical models after less
than 100 samples and saturate in performance with less than 1000 samples. We
validate the results against a collected dataset of repeated trajectories, and
use the learned models to study questions such as the nature of the variability
in pushing, and the validity of the quasi-static assumption.
"
21177,Dual constant-flux energy cascades to both large scales and small scales,"  In this paper, we present an overview of concepts and data concerning inverse
cascades of excitation towards scales larger than the forcing scale in a
variety of contexts, from two-dimensional fluids and wave turbulence, to
geophysical flows in the presence of rotation and stratification. We briefly
discuss the role of anisotropy in the occurrence and properties of such
cascades. We then show that the cascade of some invariant, for example the
total energy, may be transferred through nonlinear interactions to both the
small scales and the large scales, with in each case a constant flux. This is
in contrast to the classical picture, and we illustrate such a dual cascade in
the context of atmospheric and oceanic observations, direct numerical
simulations and modeling. We also show that this dual cascade of total energy
can in fact be decomposed in some cases into separate cascades of the kinetic
and potential energies, provided the Froude and Rossby numbers are small
enough. In all cases, the potential energy flux remains small, of the order of
10% or less relative to the kinetic energy flux. Finally, we demonstrate that,
in the small-scale inertial range, approximate equipartition between potential
and kinetic modes is obtained, leading to an energy ratio close to one, with
strong departure at large scales due to the dominant kinetic energy inverse
cascade and piling-up at the lowest spatial frequency, and at small scales due
to unbalanced dissipation processes, even though the Prandtl number is equal to
one.
"
21178,Worst-case Optimal Submodular Extensions for Marginal Estimation,"  Submodular extensions of an energy function can be used to efficiently
compute approximate marginals via variational inference. The accuracy of the
marginals depends crucially on the quality of the submodular extension. To
identify the best possible extension, we show an equivalence between the
submodular extensions of the energy and the objective functions of linear
programming (LP) relaxations for the corresponding MAP estimation problem. This
allows us to (i) establish the worst-case optimality of the submodular
extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the worst-case
optimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; and
(iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model
with the help of a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method. Using synthetic
and real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on
the log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message
passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible.
Importantly, unlike TRW, our approach provides the first practical algorithm to
compute an upper bound on the dense CRF model.
"
21179,Superconducting energy gap in $\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$: Temperature dependence,"  The superconducting energy gap of $\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ has been measured by
tunneling. Despite the fact that the sample was macroscopically single phase
with very sharp superconducting transition $T_c$ at 32~$K$, some of the
measured tunnel junctions made by point contacts between silver tip and single
crystal of $\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ had lower transition at 20~$K$. Local
variation of the potassium concentration as well as oxygen deficiency in $\rm
Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ at the place where the point contact is made can account for
the change of $T_c$. The conductance curves of the tunnel junctions reveal the
BCS behavior with a small broadening of the superconducting-gap structure. A
value of the energy gap scales with $T_c$. The reduced gap amounts to
$2\Delta/kT_c = 4÷4.3$ indicating a medium coupling strength. Temperature
dependence of the energy gap follows the BCS prediction.
"
21180,Square functions and the Hamming cube: Duality,"  For $1<p\leq 2$, any $n\geq 1$ and any $f:\{-1,1\}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$, we
obtain $(\mathbb{E} |\nabla f|^{p})^{1/p} \geq C(p)(\mathbb{E}|f|^{p} -
|\mathbb{E}f|^{p})^{1/p}$ where $C(p)$ is the smallest positive zero of the
confluent hypergeometric function ${}_{1}F_{1}(\frac{p}{2(1-p)}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{x^{2}}{2})$. Our approach is based on a certain duality between the
classical square function estimates on the Euclidean space and the gradient
estimates on the Hamming cube.
"
21181,A Special Homotopy Continuation Method For A Class of Polynomial Systems,"  A special homotopy continuation method, as a combination of the polyhedral
homotopy and the linear product homotopy, is proposed for computing all the
isolated solutions to a special class of polynomial systems. The root number
bound of this method is between the total degree bound and the mixed volume
bound and can be easily computed. The new algorithm has been implemented as a
program called LPH using C++. Our experiments show its efficiency compared to
the polyhedral or other homotopies on such systems. As an application, the
algorithm can be used to find witness points on each connected component of a
real variety.
"
21182,Arbitrage Opportunities in CDS Term Structure: Theory and Implications for OTC Derivatives,"  Absence-of-Arbitrage (AoA) is the basic assumption underpinning derivatives
pricing theory. As part of the OTC derivatives market, the CDS market not only
provides a vehicle for participants to hedge and speculate on the default risks
of corporate and sovereign entities, it also reveals important market-implied
default-risk information concerning the counterparties with which financial
institutions trade, and for which these financial institutions have to
calculate various valuation adjustments (collectively referred to as XVA) as
part of their pricing and risk management of OTC derivatives, to account for
counterparty default risks. In this study, we derive No-arbitrage conditions
for CDS term structures, first in a positive interest rate environment and then
in an arbitrary one. Using an extensive CDS dataset which covers the 2007-09
financial crisis, we present a catalogue of 2,416 pairs of anomalous CDS
contracts which violate the above conditions. Finally, we show in an example
that such anomalies in the CDS term structure can lead to persistent arbitrage
profits and to nonsensical default probabilities. The paper is a first
systematic study on CDS-term-structure arbitrage providing model-free AoA
conditions supported by ample empirical evidence.
"
21183,Asymptotic behavior of metric spaces at infinity,"  A new sequential approach to investigations of structure of metric spaces at
infinity is proposed. Criteria for finiteness and boundedness of metric spaces
at infinity are found.
"
21184,Decoupling feature extraction from policy learning: assessing benefits of state representation learning in goal based robotics,"  Scaling end-to-end reinforcement learning to control real robots from vision
presents a series of challenges, in particular in terms of sample efficiency.
Against end-to-end learning, state representation learning can help learn a
compact, efficient and relevant representation of states that speeds up policy
learning, reducing the number of samples needed, and that is easier to
interpret. We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal
based robotics tasks and propose a new unsupervised model that stacks
representations and combines strengths of several of these approaches. This
method encodes all the relevant features, performs on par or better than
end-to-end learning, and is robust to hyper-parameters change.
"
21185,$q-$difference equations concerning with $q-$gamma function,"  We consider a family of solutions of $q-$difference Riccati equation, and
prove the meromorphic solutions of $q-$difference Riccati equation and
corresponding second order $q-$difference equation are concerning with
$q-$gamma function. The growth and value distribution of differences on
solutions of $q-$difference Riccati equation are also investigated.
"
21186,Structural and Magnetic Phase Transitions in Chromium Nitride Thin Films Grown by RF Nitrogen Plasma Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"  A magneto-structural phase transition is investigated in single crystal CrN
thin films grown by rf plasma molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) substrates.
While still within the vacuum environment following MBE growth, $\it in-situ$
low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, and $\it in-situ$ variable
low-temperature reflection high energy electron diffraction are applied,
revealing an atomically smooth and metallic CrN(001) surface, and an $\it
in-plane$ structural transition from 1$\times$1 (primitive CrN unit cell) to
$\mathrm{\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}-R45^\circ}$ with a transition temperature of
$\sim$ 278 K, respectively. $\it Ex-situ$ temperature dependent measurements
are also performed, including x-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction,
looking at the structural peaks and likewise revealing a first-order structural
transition along both [001] and [111] $\it out-of-plane$ directions, with
transition temperatures of 256 K and 268 K, respectively. Turning to the
magnetic peaks, neutron diffraction confirms a clear magnetic transition from
paramagnetic at room temperature to antiferromagnetic at low temperatures with
a sharp, first-order phase transition and a N$é$el temperature of 270 K or
280 K for two different films. In addition to the experimental measurements of
structural and magnetic ordering, we also discuss results from first-principles
theoretical calculations which explore various possible magneto-structural
models.
"
21187,Predicting Audience's Laughter Using Convolutional Neural Network,"  For the purpose of automatically evaluating speakers' humor usage, we build a
presentation corpus containing humorous utterances based on TED talks. Compared
to previous data resources supporting humor recognition research, ours has
several advantages, including (a) both positive and negative instances coming
from a homogeneous data set, (b) containing a large number of speakers, and (c)
being open. Focusing on using lexical cues for humor recognition, we
systematically compare a newly emerging text classification method based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a well-established conventional
method using linguistic knowledge. The advantages of the CNN method are both
getting higher detection accuracies and being able to learn essential features
automatically.
"
21188,The Solar Orbiter Mission: an Energetic Particle Perspective,"  Solar Orbiter is a joint ESA-NASA mission planed for launch in October 2018.
The science payload includes remote-sensing and in-situ instrumentation
designed with the primary goal of understanding how the Sun creates and
controls the heliosphere. The spacecraft will follow an elliptical orbit around
the Sun, with perihelion as close as 0.28 AU. During the late orbit phase the
orbital plane will reach inclinations above 30 degrees, allowing direct
observations of the solar polar regions. The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD)
is an instrument suite consisting of several sensors measuring electrons,
protons and ions over a broad energy interval (2 keV to 15 MeV for electrons, 3
keV to 100 MeV for protons and few tens of keV/nuc to 450 MeV/nuc for ions),
providing composition, spectra, timing and anisotropy information. We present
an overview of Solar Orbiter from the energetic particle perspective,
summarizing the capabilities of EPD and the opportunities that these new
observations will provide for understanding how energetic particles are
accelerated during solar eruptions and how they propagate through the
Heliosphere.
"
21189,Consistent feature attribution for tree ensembles,"  Note that a newer expanded version of this paper is now available at:
arXiv:1802.03888
It is critical in many applications to understand what features are important
for a model, and why individual predictions were made. For tree ensemble
methods these questions are usually answered by attributing importance values
to input features, either globally or for a single prediction. Here we show
that current feature attribution methods are inconsistent, which means changing
the model to rely more on a given feature can actually decrease the importance
assigned to that feature. To address this problem we develop fast exact
solutions for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which were recently
shown to be the unique additive feature attribution method based on conditional
expectations that is both consistent and locally accurate. We integrate these
improvements into the latest version of XGBoost, demonstrate the
inconsistencies of current methods, and show how using SHAP values results in
significantly improved supervised clustering performance. Feature importance
values are a key part of understanding widely used models such as gradient
boosting trees and random forests, so improvements to them have broad practical
implications.
"
21190,K-orbit closures and Barbasch-Evens-Magyar varieties,"  We define the Barbasch-Evens-Magyar variety. We show it is isomorphic to the
smooth variety defined in [D. Barbasch-S. Evens '94] that maps finite-to-one to
a symmetric orbit closure, thereby giving a resolution of singularities in
certain cases. Our definition parallels [P. Magyar '98]'s construction of the
Bott-Samelson variety [H. C. Hansen '73, M. Demazure '74]. From this
alternative viewpoint, one deduces a graphical description in type A,
stratification into closed subvarieties of the same kind, and determination of
the torus-fixed points. Moreover, we explain how these manifolds inherit a
natural symplectic structure with Hamiltonian torus action. We then prove that
the moment polytope is expressed in terms of the moment polytope of a
Bott-Samelson variety.

21191,"A Review of Internet of Things Architecture, Technologies and Analysis Smartphone-based Attacks Against 3D printers","  Human beings cannot be happy with any kind of tiredness based work, so they
focused on machines to work on behalf of humans. The Internet-based latest
technology provides the platforms for human beings to relax and unburden
feeling. The Internet of Things (IoT) field efficiently helps human beings with
smart decisions through Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication all over the
world. It has been difficult to ignore the importance of the IoT field with the
new development of applications such as a smartphone in the present era. The
IoT field sensor plays a vital role in sensing the intelligent object/things
and making an intelligent decision after sensing the objects. The rapid
development of new applications using smartphones in the world caused all users
of the IoT community to be faced with one major challenge of security in the
form of side channel attacks against highly intensive 3D printing systems. The
smartphone formulated Intellectual property (IP) of side channel attacks
investigate against 3D printer in the physical domain through reconstructed
G-code file through primitive operations. The smartphone (Nexus 5) solved the
main problems such as orientation fixing, model accuracy of frame size and
validate the feasibility and effectiveness in real case studies against the 3D
printer. The 3D printing estimated value reached 20.2 billion of dollars in
2021. The thermal camera is used for exploring the side channel attacks after
reconstructing the objects against 3D printers. The researcher analyzed IoT

"
21192,Computable structures on topological manifolds,"  We propose a definition of computable manifold by introducing computability
as a structure that we impose to a given topological manifold, just in the same
way as differentiability or piecewise linearity are defined for smooth and PL
manifolds respectively. Using the framework of computable topology and Type-2
theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts
needed to define manifolds, like computable atlases and (computably) compatible
computable atlases. We prove that given a computable atlas $\Phi$ defined on a
set $M$, we can construct a computable topological space $(M, \tau_\Phi,
\beta_\Phi, \nu_\Phi)$, where $\tau_\Phi$ is the topology on $M$ induced by
$\Phi$ and that the equivalence class of this computable space characterizes
the computable structure determined by $\Phi$. The concept of computable
submanifold is also investigated. We show that any compact computable manifold
which satisfies a computable version of the $T_2$-separation axiom, can be
embedded as a computable submanifold of some euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{q}$,
with a computable embedding, where $\mathbb{R}^{q}$ is equipped with its usual
topology and some canonical computable encoding of all open rational balls.
"
21193,Trace-Based Run-time Analysis of Message-Passing Go Programs,"  We consider the task of analyzing message-passing programs by observing their
run-time behavior.
We introduce a purely library-based instrumentation method to trace
communication events during execution. A model of the dependencies among events
can be constructed to identify potential bugs. Compared to the vector clock
method, our approach is much simpler and has in general a significant lower
run-time overhead.
A further advantage is that we also trace events that could not commit. Thus,
we can infer alternative communications. This provides the user with additional
information to identify potential bugs.
We have fully implemented our approach in the Go programming language and
provide a number of examples to substantiate our claims.
"
21194,An efficient algorithm for global interval solution of nonlinear algebraic equations and its GPGPU implementation,"  Solving nonlinear algebraic equations is a classic mathematics problem, and
common in scientific researches and engineering applications. There are many
numeric, symbolic and numeric-symbolic methods of solving (real) solutions.
Unlucky, these methods are constrained by some factors, e.g., high complexity,
slow serial calculation, and the notorious intermediate expression expansion.
Especially when the count of variables is larger than six, the efficiency is
decreasing drastically. In this paper, according to the property of physical
world, we pay attention to nonlinear algebraic equations whose variables are in
fixed constraints, and get meaningful real solutions. Combining with
parallelism of GPGPU, we present an efficient algorithm, by searching the
solution space globally and solving the nonlinear algebraic equations with real
interval solutions. Furthermore, we realize the Hansen-Sengupta method on
GPGPU. The experiments show that our method can solve many nonlinear algebraic
equations, and the results are accurate and more efficient compared to
traditional serial methods.
"
21195,Efficient improvement of frequency-domain Kalman filter,"  The frequency-domain Kalman filter (FKF) has been utilized in many audio
signal processing applications due to its fast convergence speed and
robustness. However, the performance of the FKF in under-modeling situations
has not been investigated. This paper presents an analysis of the steady-state
behavior of the commonly used diagonalized FKF and reveals that it suffers from
a biased solution in under-modeling scenarios. Two efficient improvements of
the FKF are proposed, both having the benefits of the guaranteed optimal
steady-state behavior at the cost of a very limited increase of the
computational burden. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithms is
also compared analytically. Computer simulations are conducted to validate the
improved performance of the proposed methods.

contributions to the Open Symposium of the ESPG'12.
"
21197,Detection and numerical simulation of optoacoustic near- and farfield signals observed in PVA hydrogel phantoms,"  We present numerical simulations for modelling optoacoustic (OA) signals
observed in PVA hydrogel tissue phantoms. We review the computational approach
to model the underlying mechanisms, i.e. optical absorption of laser energy and
acoustic propagation of mechanical stress, geared towards experiments that
involve absorbing media only. We apply the numerical procedure to model signals
observed in the acoustic near- and farfield in both, forward and backward
detection mode, in PVA hydrogel tissue phantoms (i.e. an elastic solid).
Further, we illustrate the computational approach by modeling OA signal for
several experiments on dye solution (i.e. a liquid) reported in the literature,
and benchmark the research code by comparing our fully 3D procedure to limiting
cases described in terms of effectively 1D approaches.
"
21198,Application of Bitcoin Data-Structures & Design Principles to Supply Chain Management,"  Heretofore the concept of ""blockchain"" has not been precisely defined.
Accordingly the potential useful applications of this technology have been
largely inflated. This work sidesteps the question of what constitutes a
blockchain as such and focuses on the architectural components of the Bitcoin
cryptocurrency, insofar as possible, in isolation. We consider common problems
inherent in the design of effective supply chain management systems. With each
identified problem we propose a solution that utilizes one or more component
aspects of Bitcoin. This culminates in five design principles for increased
efficiency in supply chain management systems through the application of
incentive mechanisms and data structures native to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency
protocol.
"
21199,Measuring Comodules and Enrichment,"  We study the existence of universal measuring comodules Q(M,N) for a pair of
modules M,N in a braided monoidal closed category, and the associated
enrichment of the global category of modules over the monoidal global category
of comodules. In the process, we use results for general fibred adjunctions
encompassing the fibred structure of modules over monoids and the opfibred
structure of comodules over comonoids. We also explore applications to the
theory of Hopf modules.
"
21200,Bond Graph Representation of Chemical Reaction Networks,"  The Bond Graph approach and the Chemical Reaction Network approach to
modelling biomolecular systems developed independently. This paper brings
together the two approaches by providing a bond graph interpretation of the
chemical reaction network concept of complexes. Both closed and open systems
are discussed.
The method is illustrated using a simple enzyme-catalysed reaction and a
trans-membrane transporter.
"
21201,Skew Brownian motion with dry friction: The Pugachev-Sveshnikov approach,"  The Caughey-Dieness process, also known as the Brownian motion with two
valued drift, is used in theoretical physics as an advanced model of the
Brownian particle velocity if the resistant force is assumed to be dry
friction. This process also appears in many other fields, such as applied
physics, mechanics, astrophysics, and pure mathematics. In the present paper we
are concerned with a more general process, skew Brownian motion with dry
friction. The probability distribution of the process itself and of its
occupation time on the positive half line are studied. The approach based on
the Pugachev-Sveshnikov equation is used.

21202,Numerical modeling of laser-driven experiments aiming to demonstrate magnetic field amplification via turbulent dynamo,"  The universe is permeated by magnetic fields, with strengths ranging from a
femtogauss in the voids between the filaments of galaxy clusters to several
teragauss in black holes and neutron stars. The standard model behind
cosmological magnetic fields is the nonlinear amplification of seed fields via
turbulent dynamo to the values observed. We have conceived experiments that aim
to demonstrate and study the turbulent dynamo mechanism in the laboratory. Here
we describe the design of these experiments through simulation campaigns using
FLASH, a highly capable radiation magnetohydrodynamics code that we have
developed, and large-scale three-dimensional simulations on the Mira
supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. The simulation results indicate
that the experimental platform may be capable of reaching a turbulent plasma
state and study dynamo amplification. We validate and compare our numerical
results with a small subset of experimental data using synthetic diagnostics.
"
21203,The Minimum Distance Estimation with Multiple Integral in Panel Data,"  This paper studies the minimum distance estimation problem for panel data
model. We propose the minimum distance estimators of regression parameters of
the panel data model and investigate their asymptotic distributions. This paper
contains two main contributions. First, the domain of application of the
minimum distance estimation method is extended to the panel data model. Second,
the proposed estimators are more efficient than other existing ones. Simulation
studies compare performance of the proposed estimators with performance of
others and demonstrate some superiority of our estimators.
"
21204,Towards Proving the Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks,"  Autonomous vehicles are highly complex systems, required to function reliably
in a wide variety of situations. Manually crafting software controllers for
these vehicles is difficult, but there has been some success in using deep
neural networks generated using machine-learning. However, deep neural networks
are opaque to human engineers, rendering their correctness very difficult to
prove manually; and existing automated techniques, which were not designed to
operate on neural networks, fail to scale to large systems. This paper focuses
on proving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, i.e. proving
that small perturbations to a correctly-classified input to the network cannot
cause it to be misclassified. We describe some of our recent and ongoing work
on verifying the adversarial robustness of networks, and discuss some of the
open questions we have encountered and how they might be addressed.
"
21205,Deep learning-based numerical methods for high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations and backward stochastic differential equations,"  We propose a new algorithm for solving parabolic partial differential
equations (PDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in high
dimension, by making an analogy between the BSDE and reinforcement learning
with the gradient of the solution playing the role of the policy function, and
the loss function given by the error between the prescribed terminal condition
and the solution of the BSDE. The policy function is then approximated by a
neural network, as is done in deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results
using TensorFlow illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
algorithms for several 100-dimensional nonlinear PDEs from physics and finance
such as the Allen-Cahn equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a
nonlinear pricing model for financial derivatives.
"
21206,Robust Fusion Methods for Big Data,"  We address one of the important problems in Big Data, namely how to combine
estimators from different subsamples by robust fusion procedures, when we are
unable to deal with the whole sample.
"
21207,Reconstruction of Galaxy Star Formation Histories through SED Fitting: The Dense Basis Approach,"  We introduce the Dense Basis method for Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)
fitting. It accurately recovers traditional SED parameters, including M$_*$,
SFR and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about
the number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar
mass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using
basis Star Formation Histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit
of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train
and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at $z =1$ drawn from
stochastic realisations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological
hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a
sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at $1<z<1.5$ to illustrate its
capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six
parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential,
bessel-exponential, lognormal and gaussian SFHs and reject the traditional
parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the
bias and scatter of each parametrization. $15\%$ of galaxies in our CANDELS
sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction
decreasing above $M_*>10^{9.5}M_\odot$. About $40\%$ of the CANDELS galaxies
have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation. The Dense
Basis method is scalable and offers a general approach to a broad class of
data-science problems.
"
21208,Two-stage multipolar ordering in Pr(TM)$_2$Al$_{20}$ Kondo materials,"  Among heavy fermion materials, there is a set of rare-earth intermetallics
with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ $4f^2$ moments which exhibit a rich phase diagram
with intertwined quadrupolar orders, superconductivity, and non-Fermi liquid
behavior. However, more subtle broken symmetries such as multipolar orders in
these Kondo materials remain poorly studied. Here, we argue that multi-spin
interactions between local moments beyond the conventional two-spin exchange
must play an important role in Kondo materials near the ordered to heavy Fermi
liquid transition. We show that this drives a plethora of phases with
coexisting multipolar orders and multiple thermal phase transitions, providing
a natural framework for interpreting experiments on the Pr(TM)$_2$Al$_{20}$
class of compounds.
"
21209,Spin-Momentum Locking in the Near Field of Metal Nanoparticles,"  Light carries both spin and momentum. Spin-orbit interactions of light come
into play at the subwavelength scale of nano-optics and nano-photonics, where
they determine the behaviour of light. These phenomena, in which the spin
affects and controls the spatial degrees of freedom of light, are attracting
rapidly growing interest. Here we present results on the spin-momentum locking
in the near field of metal nanostructures supporting localized surface
resonances. These systems can confine light to very small dimensions below the
diffraction limit, leading to a striking near-field enhancement. In contrast to
the propagating evanescent waves of surface plasmon-polariton modes, the
electromagnetic near-field of localized surface resonances does not exhibit a
definite position-independent momentum or polarization. Our results can be
useful to investigate the spin-orbit interactions of light for complex
evanescent fields. Note that the spin of the incident light can control the
rotation direction of the canonical momentum.
"
21210,Persistence and extinction for stochastic ecological difference equations with feedbacks,"  Species' densities experience both internal frequency-dependent feedbacks due
to population structure and external feedbacks from abiotic factors. These
feedbacks can determine whether populations persist or go extinct, and may be
subject to stochastic fluctuations. To provide a general mathematical framework
for studying these effects, we develop theorems for stochastic persistence and
exclusion for stochastic ecological difference equations accounting for
feedbacks. Specifically, we use the stochastic analog of average Lyapunov
functions to develop sufficient and necessary conditions for (i) all population
densities spending little time at low densities i.e. stochastic persistence,
and (ii) population trajectories asymptotically approaching the extinction set
with positive probability. For (i) and (ii), respectively, we provide
quantitative estimates on the fraction of time that the system is near the
extinction set, and the probability of asymptotic extinction as a function of
the initial state of the system. Furthermore, in the case of persistence, we
provide lower bounds for the time to escape neighborhoods of the extinction
set. To illustrate the applicability of our results, we analyze models of
evolutionary games, stochastic Lotka-Volterra difference equations, trait
evolution, and spatially structured disease dynamics. Our analysis of these
models demonstrates environmental stochasticity facilitates coexistence in the
hawk-dove game, but inhibits coexistence in the rock-paper-scissors game and
Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. Furthermore, environmental fluctuations
with positive auto-correlations can promote persistence of evolving populations
and disease persistence in patchy landscapes. While these results help close
the gap between persistence theories for deterministic and stochastic systems,
we conclude by highlighting several challenges for future research.
"
21211,Stochastic reachability of a target tube: Theory and computation,"  Given a discrete-time stochastic system and a time-varying sequence of target
sets, we consider the problem of maximizing the probability of the state
evolving within this tube under bounded control authority. This problem
subsumes existing work on stochastic viability and terminal hitting-time
stochastic reach-avoid problems. Of special interest is the stochastic reach
set, the set of all initial states from which the probability of staying in the
target tube is above a desired threshold. This set provides non-trivial
information about the safety and the performance of the system. In this paper,
we provide sufficient conditions under which the stochastic reach set is
closed, compact, and convex. We also discuss an underapproximative
interpolation technique for stochastic reach sets. Finally, we propose a
scalable, grid-free, and anytime algorithm that computes a polytopic
underapproximation of the stochastic reach set and synthesizes an open-loop
controller using convex optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy and
scalability of our approach over existing techniques using three numerical
simulations --- stochastic viability of a chain of integrators, stochastic
reach-avoid computation for a satellite rendezvous and docking problem, and
stochastic reachability of a target tube for a Dubin's car with a known turning
rate sequence.
"
21212,Bright soliton to quantum droplet transition in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates,"  Attractive Bose-Einstein condensates can host two types of macroscopic
self-bound states of different nature: bright solitons and quantum liquid
droplets. Here, we investigate the connection between them with a Bose-Bose
mixture confined in an optical waveguide. We develop a simple theoretical model
to show that, depending on atom number and interaction strength, solitons and
droplets can be smoothly connected or remain distinct states coexisting only in
a bi-stable region. We experimentally measure their spin composition, extract
their density for a broad range of parameters and map out the boundary of the
region separating solitons from droplets.
"
21213,Upper bounds for the spectral function on homogeneous spaces via volume growth,"  We use spectral embeddings to give upper bounds on the spectral function of
the Laplace--Beltrami operator on homogeneous spaces in terms of the volume
growth of balls. In the case of compact manifolds, our bounds extend the 1980
lower bound of Peter Li for the smallest positive eigenvalue to all
eigenvalues. We also improve Li's bound itself. Our bounds translate to
explicit upper bounds on the heat kernel for both compact and noncompact
homogeneous spaces.
"
21214,An impossibility theorem for gerrymandering,"  The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether a proposed
mathematical formula should be used to detect unconstitutional partisan
gerrymandering. We show that in some cases, this formula will only flag
bizarrely shaped districts as potentially constitutional.
"
21215,Cooling-Rate Effects in Sodium Silicate Glasses: Bridging the Gap between Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Experiments,"  Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are commonly used to predict the
structure and properties of glasses, they are intrinsically limited to short
time scales, necessitating the use of fast cooling rates. It is therefore
challenging to compare results from MD simulations to experimental results for
glasses cooled on typical laboratory time scales. Based on MD simulations of a
sodium silicate glass with varying cooling rate (from 0.01 to 100 K/ps), here
we show that thermal history primarily affects the medium-range order
structure, while the short-range order is largely unaffected over the range of
cooling rates simulated. This results in a decoupling between the enthalpy and
volume relaxation functions, where the enthalpy quickly plateaus as the cooling
rate decreases, whereas density exhibits a slower relaxation. Finally, we
demonstrate that the outcomes of MD simulations can be meaningfully compared to
experimental values if properly extrapolated to slower cooling rates.
"
21216,Representation Learning for Scale-free Networks,"  Network embedding aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of
vertexes in a network, while structure and inherent properties of the network
is preserved. Existing network embedding works primarily focus on preserving
the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximity of
vertexes, while the macroscopic scale-free property is largely ignored.
Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed
distribution (i.e., only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical
property of real-world networks, such as social networks. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning representations for scale-free networks. We first
theoretically analyze the difficulty of embedding and reconstructing a
scale-free network in the Euclidean space, by converting our problem to the
sphere packing problem. Then, we propose the ""degree penalty"" principle for
designing scale-free property preserving network embedding algorithm: punishing
the proximity between high-degree vertexes. We introduce two implementations of
our principle by utilizing the spectral techniques and a skip-gram model
respectively. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our algorithms
are able to not only reconstruct heavy-tailed distributed degree distribution,
but also outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various network mining
tasks, such as vertex classification and link prediction.
"
21217,"Extractive Summarization: Limits, Compression, Generalized Model and Heuristics","  Due to its promise to alleviate information overload, text summarization has
attracted the attention of many researchers. However, it has remained a serious
challenge. Here, we first prove empirical limits on the recall (and F1-scores)
of extractive summarizers on the DUC datasets under ROUGE evaluation for both
the single-document and multi-document summarization tasks. Next we define the
concept of compressibility of a document and present a new model of
summarization, which generalizes existing models in the literature and
integrates several dimensions of the summarization, viz., abstractive versus
extractive, single versus multi-document, and syntactic versus semantic.
Finally, we examine some new and existing single-document summarization
algorithms in a single framework and compare with state of the art summarizers
on DUC data.
"
21218,Backprop as Functor: A compositional perspective on supervised learning,"  A supervised learning algorithm searches over a set of functions $A \to B$
parametrised by a space $P$ to find the best approximation to some ideal
function $f\colon A \to B$. It does this by taking examples $(a,f(a)) \in
A\times B$, and updating the parameter according to some rule. We define a
category where these update rules may be composed, and show that gradient
descent---with respect to a fixed step size and an error function satisfying a
certain property---defines a monoidal functor from a category of parametrised
functions to this category of update rules. This provides a structural
perspective on backpropagation, as well as a broad generalisation of neural
networks.
"
21219,Entropic selection of concepts unveils hidden topics in documents corpora,"  The organization and evolution of science has recently become itself an
object of scientific quantitative investigation, thanks to the wealth of
information that can be extracted from scientific documents, such as citations
between papers and co-authorship between researchers. However, only few studies
have focused on the concepts that characterize full documents and that can be
extracted and analyzed, revealing the deeper organization of scientific
knowledge. Unfortunately, several concepts can be so common across documents
that they hinder the emergence of the underlying topical structure of the
document corpus, because they give rise to a large amount of spurious and
trivial relations among documents. To identify and remove common concepts, we
introduce a method to gauge their relevance according to an objective
information-theoretic measure related to the statistics of their occurrence
across the document corpus. After progressively removing concepts that,
according to this metric, can be considered as generic, we find that the topic
organization displays a correspondingly more refined structure.
"
21220,An Optimal Multi-layer Reinsurance Policy under Conditional Tail Expectation,"  A usual reinsurance policy for insurance companies admits one or two layers
of the payment deductions. Under optimal criterion of minimizing the
conditional tail expectation (CTE) risk measure of the insurer's total risk,
this article generalized an optimal stop-loss reinsurance policy to an optimal
multi-layer reinsurance policy. To achieve such optimal multi-layer reinsurance
policy, this article starts from a given optimal stop-loss reinsurance policy
$f(\cdot).$ In the first step, it cuts down an interval $[0,\infty)$ into two
intervals $[0,M_1)$ and $[M_1,\infty).$ By shifting the origin of Cartesian
coordinate system to $(M_{1},f(M_{1})),$ and showing that under the $CTE$
criteria $f(x)I_{[0, M_1)}(x)+(f(M_1)+f(x-M_1))I_{[M_1,\infty)}(x)$ is, again,
an optimal policy. This extension procedure can be repeated to obtain an
optimal k-layer reinsurance policy. Finally, unknown parameters of the optimal
multi-layer reinsurance policy are estimated using some additional appropriate
criteria. Three simulation-based studies have been conducted to demonstrate:
({\bf 1}) The practical applications of our findings and ({\bf 2}) How one may
employ other appropriate criteria to estimate unknown parameters of an optimal
multi-layer contract. The multi-layer reinsurance policy, similar to the
original stop-loss reinsurance policy is optimal, in a same sense. Moreover it
has some other optimal criteria which the original policy does not have. Under
optimal criterion of minimizing general translative and monotone risk measure
$\rho(\cdot)$ of {\it either} the insurer's total risk {\it or} both the
insurer's and the reinsurer's total risks, this article (in its discussion)
also extends a given optimal reinsurance contract $f(\cdot)$ to a multi-layer
and continuous reinsurance policy.
"
21221,"Tusnády's problem, the transference principle, and non-uniform QMC sampling","  It is well-known that for every $N \geq 1$ and $d \geq 1$ there exist point
sets $x_1, \dots, x_N \in [0,1]^d$ whose discrepancy with respect to the
Lebesgue measure is of order at most $(\log N)^{d-1} N^{-1}$. In a more general
setting, the first author proved together with Josef Dick that for any
normalized measure $\mu$ on $[0,1]^d$ there exist points $x_1, \dots, x_N$
whose discrepancy with respect to $\mu$ is of order at most $(\log
N)^{(3d+1)/2} N^{-1}$. The proof used methods from combinatorial mathematics,
and in particular a result of Banaszczyk on balancings of vectors. In the
present note we use a version of the so-called transference principle together
with recent results on the discrepancy of red-blue colorings to show that for
any $\mu$ there even exist points having discrepancy of order at most $(\log
N)^{d-\frac12} N^{-1}$, which is almost as good as the discrepancy bound in the
case of the Lebesgue measure.
"
21222,HBT+: an improved code for finding subhalos and building merger trees in cosmological simulations,"  Dark matter subhalos are the remnants of (incomplete) halo mergers.
Identifying them and establishing their evolutionary links in the form of
merger trees is one of the most important applications of cosmological
simulations. The Hierachical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code identifies halos as they
form and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting
subhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation
of this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more
physically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+ to cosmological
simulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass
function are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between
the two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive
subhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal
stripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more
concentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos.
Subhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the
masses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This
may explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster
centres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the
peak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and the
merger trees constructed using HBT+ do not suffer from the missing or switched
links that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo
finders. We make the HBT+ code publicly available.
"
21223,On Statistical Non-Significance,"  Significance tests are probably the most extended form of inference in
empirical research, and significance is often interpreted as providing greater
informational content than non-significance. In this article we show, however,
that rejection of a point null often carries very little information, while
failure to reject may be highly informative. This is particularly true in
empirical contexts where data sets are large and where there are rarely reasons
to put substantial prior probability on a point null. Our results challenge the
usual practice of conferring point null rejections a higher level of scientific
significance than non-rejections. In consequence, we advocate a visible
reporting and discussion of non-significant results in empirical practice.
"
21224,On the Interplay between Strong Regularity and Graph Densification,"  In this paper we analyze the practical implications of Szemerédi's
regularity lemma in the preservation of metric information contained in large
graphs. To this end, we present a heuristic algorithm to find regular
partitions. Our experiments show that this method is quite robust to the
natural sparsification of proximity graphs. In addition, this robustness can be
enforced by graph densification.
"
21225,Nonabelian Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence,"  In this paper, we study the bigraded vector space structure of
Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. We prove the formula for the generating function of
the Hodge numbers of possibly nonabelian Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. As an
application, we calculate the Hodge numbers for all nondegenerate quintic
homogeneous polynomials with five variables. These results yield an evidence
for the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence between the Calabi-Yau
geometries and the Landau-Ginzburg B-models.
"
21226,Setpoint Tracking with Partially Observed Loads,"  We use online convex optimization (OCO) for setpoint tracking with uncertain,
flexible loads. We consider full feedback from the loads, bandit feedback, and
two intermediate types of feedback: partial bandit where a subset of the loads
are individually observed and the rest are observed in aggregate, and Bernoulli
feedback where in each round the aggregator receives either full or bandit
feedback according to a known probability. We give sublinear regret bounds in
all cases. We numerically evaluate our algorithms on examples with
thermostatically controlled loads and electric vehicles.
"
21227,Size effect in the ionization energy of PAH clusters,"  We report the first experimental measurement of the near-threshold
photo-ionization spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon clusters made of
pyrene C16H10 and coronene C24H12, obtained using imaging photoelectron
photoion coincidence spectrometry with a VUV synchrotron beamline. The
experimental results of the ionization energy are confronted to calculated ones
obtained from simulations using dedicated electronic structure treatment for
large ionized molecular clusters. Experiment and theory consistently find a
decrease of the ionization energy with cluster size. The inclusion of
temperature effects in the simulations leads to a lowering of this energy and
to a quantitative agreement with the experiment. In the case of pyrene, both
theory and experiment show a discontinuity in the IE trend for the hexamer.
"
21228,Runaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing,"  Predictive policing systems are increasingly used to determine how to
allocate police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime
data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process
is repeated. Such systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to
runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same
neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.
In response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that
proves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits
such problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive
policing system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not
occur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are
quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to
which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between
areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which \emph{reported}
incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and \emph{discovered}
incidents of crime (i.e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched
as a result of the predictive policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while
reported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot
entirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.
"
21229,AWAKE-related benchmarking tests for simulation codes,"  Two tests are described that were developed for benchmarking and comparison
of numerical codes in the context of AWAKE experiment.
"
21230,Ricci-flat metrics on the cone over $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$,"  We describe a framework for constructing the Ricci-flat metrics on the total
space of the canonical bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$
(the del Pezzo surface of rank one). We construct explicitly the first-order
deformation of the so-called `orthotoric metric' on this manifold. We also show
that the deformation of the corresponding conformal Killing-Yano form does not
exist.
"
21231,Solving Zero-sum Games using Best Response Oracles with Applications to Search Games,"  We present efficient algorithms for computing optimal or approximately
optimal strategies in a zero-sum game for which Player I has n pure strategies
and Player II has an arbitrary number of pure strategies. We assume that for
any given mixed strategy of Player I, a best response or ""approximate"" best
response of Player II can be found by an oracle in time polynomial in n. We
then show how our algorithms may be applied to several search games with
applications to security and counter-terrorism. We evaluate our main algorithm
experimentally on a prototypical search game. Our results show it performs well
compared to an existing, well-known algorithm for solving zero-sum games that
can also be used to solve search games, given a best response oracle.
"
21232,On the idea of a new artificial intelligence based optimization algorithm inspired from the nature of vortex,"  In this paper, the idea of a new artificial intelligence based optimization
algorithm, which is inspired from the nature of vortex, has been provided
briefly. As also a bio-inspired computation algorithm, the idea is generally
focused on a typical vortex flow / behavior in nature and inspires from some
dynamics that are occurred in the sense of vortex nature. Briefly, the
algorithm is also a swarm-oriented evolutional problem solution approach;
because it includes many methods related to elimination of weak swarm members
and trying to improve the solution process by supporting the solution space via
new swarm members. In order have better idea about success of the algorithm; it
has been tested via some benchmark functions. At this point, the obtained
results show that the algorithm can be an alternative to the literature in
terms of single-objective optimization solution ways. Vortex Optimization
Algorithm (VOA) is the name suggestion by the authors; for this new idea of
intelligent optimization approach.
"
21233,Sulfur Hazes in Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres: Impacts on Reflected Light Spectra,"  Recent work has shown that sulfur hazes may arise in the atmospheres of some
giant exoplanets due to the photolysis of H$_{2}$S. We investigate the impact
such a haze would have on an exoplanet's geometric albedo spectrum and how it
may affect the direct imaging results of WFIRST, a planned NASA space
telescope. For temperate (250 K $<$ T$_{\rm eq}$ $<$ 700 K) Jupiter--mass
planets, photochemical destruction of H$_{2}$S results in the production of
$\sim$1 ppmv of \seight between 100 and 0.1 mbar, which, if cool enough, will
condense to form a haze. Nominal haze masses are found to drastically alter a
planet's geometric albedo spectrum: whereas a clear atmosphere is dark at
wavelengths between 0.5 and 1 $\mu$m due to molecular absorption, the addition
of a sulfur haze boosts the albedo there to $\sim$0.7 due to scattering. Strong
absorption by the haze shortward of 0.4 $\mu$m results in albedos $<$0.1, in
contrast to the high albedos produced by Rayleigh scattering in a clear
atmosphere. As a result, the color of the planet shifts from blue to orange.
The existence of a sulfur haze masks the molecular signatures of methane and
water, thereby complicating the characterization of atmospheric composition.
Detection of such a haze by WFIRST is possible, though discriminating between a
sulfur haze and any other highly reflective, high altitude scatterer will
require observations shortward of 0.4 $\mu$m, which is currently beyond
WFIRST's design.
"
21234,Real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of the amygdala activity with simultaneous EEG in veterans with combat-related PTSD,"  Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling
neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of
the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback
(rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the
amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion
self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf
of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, n=20)
learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala (LA) using rtfMRI-nf
during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG,
n=11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf
training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI.
PTSD severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).
The EG participants showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings,
including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms.
Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful
reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. During the first
session, fMRI connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this
enhancement significantly and positively correlated with initial CAPS ratings.
Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a
significant positive correlation with the initial CAPS. Reduction in PTSD
severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated
with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC.
Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity has the
potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity
deficiencies specific to PTSD.
"
21235,Approximations from Anywhere and General Rough Sets,"  Not all approximations arise from information systems. The problem of fitting
approximations, subjected to some rules (and related data), to information
systems in a rough scheme of things is known as the \emph{inverse problem}. The
inverse problem is more general than the duality (or abstract representation)
problems and was introduced by the present author in her earlier papers. From
the practical perspective, a few (as opposed to one) theoretical frameworks may
be suitable for formulating the problem itself. \emph{Granular operator spaces}
have been recently introduced and investigated by the present author in her
recent work in the context of antichain based and dialectical semantics for
general rough sets. The nature of the inverse problem is examined from
number-theoretic and combinatorial perspectives in a higher order variant of
granular operator spaces and some necessary conditions are proved. The results
and the novel approach would be useful in a number of unsupervised and semi
supervised learning contexts and algorithms.
"
21236,The minimal volume of simplices containing a convex body,"  Let $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ be a convex body with barycenter at the origin.
We show there is a simplex $S \subset K$ having also barycenter at the origin
such that $\left(\frac{vol(S)}{vol(K)}\right)^{1/n} \geq \frac{c}{\sqrt{n}},$
where $c>0$ is an absolute constant. This is achieved using stochastic
geometric techniques. Precisely, if $K$ is in isotropic position, we present a
method to find centered simplices verifying the above bound that works with
very high probability.
As a consequence, we provide correct asymptotic estimates on an old problem
in convex geometry. Namely, we show that the simplex $S_{min}(K)$ of minimal
volume enclosing a given convex body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$, fulfills the
following inequality $$\left(\frac{vol(S_{min}(K))}{vol(K)}\right)^{1/n} \leq d
\sqrt{n},$$ for some absolute constant $d>0$. Up to the constant, the estimate
cannot be lessened.

21237,Socioeconomic bias in influenza surveillance,"  Individuals in low socioeconomic brackets are considered at-risk for
developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than
average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been
attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and
therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate
influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to
accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United
States of America's primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet)
monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to
lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate
internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance
systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak
detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical
framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the
adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google
Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels.
We find that zip codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical
blind-spot for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to
ameliorate.
"
21238,Java Code Analysis and Transformation into AWS Lambda Functions,"  Software developers are faced with the issue of either adapting their
programming model to the execution model (e.g. cloud platforms) or finding
appropriate tools to adapt the model and code automatically. A recent execution
model which would benefit from automated enablement is Function-as-a-Service.
Automating this process requires a pipeline which includes steps for code
analysis, transformation and deployment. In this paper, we outline the design
and runtime characteristics of Podilizer, a tool which implements the pipeline
specifically for Java source code as input and AWS Lambda as output. We
contribute technical and economic metrics about this concrete 'FaaSification'
process by observing the behaviour of Podilizer with two representative Java
software projects.
"
21239,Criteria for Finite Difference Groebner Bases of Normal Binomial Difference Ideals,"  In this paper, we give decision criteria for normal binomial difference
polynomial ideals in the univariate difference polynomial ring F{y} to have
finite difference Groebner bases and an algorithm to compute the finite
difference Groebner bases if these criteria are satisfied. The novelty of these
criteria lies in the fact that complicated properties about difference
polynomial ideals are reduced to elementary properties of univariate
polynomials in Z[x].
"
21240,$p$-Euler equations and $p$-Navier-Stokes equations,"  We propose in this work new systems of equations which we call $p$-Euler
equations and $p$-Navier-Stokes equations. $p$-Euler equations are derived as
the Euler-Lagrange equations for the action represented by the Benamou-Brenier
characterization of Wasserstein-$p$ distances, with incompressibility
constraint. $p$-Euler equations have similar structures with the usual Euler
equations but the `momentum' is the signed ($p-1$)-th power of the velocity. In
the 2D case, the $p$-Euler equations have streamfunction-vorticity formulation,
where the vorticity is given by the $p$-Laplacian of the streamfunction. By
adding diffusion presented by $\gamma$-Laplacian of the velocity, we obtain
what we call $p$-Navier-Stokes equations. If $\gamma=p$, the {\it a priori}
energy estimates for the velocity and momentum have dual symmetries. Using
these energy estimates and a time-shift estimate, we show the global existence
of weak solutions for the $p$-Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$\gamma=p$ and $p\ge d\ge 2$ through a compactness criterion.
"
21241,Unconventional minimal subtraction and Bogoliubov-Parasyuk-Hepp-Zimmermann: massive scalar theory and critical exponents,"  We introduce a simpler although unconventional minimal subtraction
renormalization procedure in the case of a massive scalar $\lambda \phi^{4}$
theory in Euclidean space using dimensional regularization. We show that this
method is very similar to its counterpart in massless field theory. In
particular, the choice of using the bare mass at higher perturbative order
instead of employing its tree-level counterpart eliminates all tadpole
insertions at that order. As an application, we compute diagrammatically the
critical exponents $\eta$ and $\nu$ at least up to two loops. We perform an
explicit comparison with the Bogoliubov-Parasyuk-Hepp-Zimmermann ($BPHZ$)
method at the same loop order, show that the proposed method requires fewer
diagrams and establish a connection between the two approaches.
"
21242,A covering theorem for singular measures in the Euclidean space,"  We prove that for any singular measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ it is possible
to cover $\mu$-almost every point with $n$ families of Lipschitz slabs of
arbitrarily small total width. More precisely, up to a rotation, for every
$\delta>0$ there are $n$ countable families of $1$-Lipschitz functions
$\{f_i^1\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}},\ldots, \{f_i^n\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}},$
$f_i^j:\{x_j=0\}\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, and $n$ sequences of
positive real numbers $\{\varepsilon_i^1\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}},\ldots,
\{\varepsilon_i^n\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that, denoting $\hat x_j$ the
orthogonal projection of the point $x$ onto $\{x_j=0\}$ and
$$I_i^j:=\{x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}^n:f_i^j(\hat x_j)-\varepsilon_i^j<
x_j< f_i^j(\hat x_j)+\varepsilon_i^j\},$$ it holds
$\sum_{i,j}\varepsilon_i^j\leq \delta$ and
$\mu(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\bigcup_{i,j}I_i^j)=0.$
We apply this result to show that, if $\mu$ is not absolutely continuous, it
is possible to approximate the identity with a sequence $g_h$ of smooth
equi-Lipschitz maps satisfying
$$\limsup_{h\to\infty}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}{\rm{det}}(\nabla g_h)
d\mu<\mu(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ From this, we deduce a simple proof of the fact that
every top-dimensional Ambrosio-Kirchheim metric current in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a
Federer-Fleming flat chain.
"
21243,Linear-Time Algorithms for Maximum-Weight Induced Matchings and Minimum Chain Covers in Convex Bipartite Graphs,"  A bipartite graph $G=(U,V,E)$ is convex if the vertices in $V$ can be
linearly ordered such that for each vertex $u\in U$, the neighbors of $u$ are
consecutive in the ordering of $V$. An induced matching $H$ of $G$ is a
matching such that no edge of $E$ connects endpoints of two different edges of
$H$. We show that in a convex bipartite graph with $n$ vertices and $m$
weighted edges, an induced matching of maximum total weight can be computed in
$O(n+m)$ time. An unweighted convex bipartite graph has a representation of
size $O(n)$ that records for each vertex $u\in U$ the first and last neighbor
in the ordering of $V$. Given such a compact representation, we compute an
induced matching of maximum cardinality in $O(n)$ time.
In convex bipartite graphs, maximum-cardinality induced matchings are dual to
minimum chain covers. A chain cover is a covering of the edge set by chain
subgraphs, that is, subgraphs that do not contain induced matchings of more
than one edge. Given a compact representation, we compute a representation of a
minimum chain cover in $O(n)$ time. If no compact representation is given, the
cover can be computed in $O(n+m)$ time.
All of our algorithms achieve optimal running time for the respective problem
and model. Previous algorithms considered only the unweighted case, and the
best algorithm for computing a maximum-cardinality induced matching or a
minimum chain cover in a convex bipartite graph had a running time of $O(n^2)$.
"
21244,Enhanced steady-state dissolution flux in reactive convective dissolution,"  Chemical reactions can accelerate, slow down or even be at the very origin of
the development of dissolution-driven convection in partially miscible
stratifications, when they impact the density profile in the host fluid phase.
We numerically analyze the dynamics of this reactive convective dissolution in
the fully developed non-linear regime for a phase A dissolving into a host
layer containing a dissolved reactant B. We show that for a general
A+B$\rightarrow$C reaction in solution, the dynamics vary with the Rayleigh
numbers of the chemical species, i.e. with the nature of the chemicals in the
host phase. Depending on whether the reaction slows down, accelerates or is at
the origin of the development of convection, the spatial distributions of
species A, B or C, the dissolution flux and the reaction rate are different. We
show that chemical reactions enhance the steady-state flux as they consume A
and can induce more intense convection than in the absence of reactions. This
result is important in the context of CO$_2$ geological sequestration where
quantifying the storage rate of CO$_2$ dissolving into the host oil or aqueous
phase is crucial to assess the efficiency and the safety of the project.
"
21245,Vapor Condensed and Supercooled Glassy Nanoclusters,"  We use molecular simulation to study the structural and dynamic properties of
glassy nanoclusters formed both through the direct condensation of the vapor
below the glass transition temperature, without the presence of a substrate,
and \textit{via} the slow supercooling of unsupported liquid nanodroplets. An
analysis of local structure using Voronoi polyhedra shows that the energetic
stability of the clusters is characterized by a large, increasing fraction of
bicapped square antiprism motifs. We also show that nanoclusters with similar
inherent structure energies are structurally similar, independent of their
history, which suggests the supercooled clusters access the same low energy
regions of the potential energy landscape as the vapor condensed clusters
despite their different methods of formation. By measuring the intermediate
scattering function at different radii from the cluster center, we find that
the relaxation dynamics of the clusters are inhomogeneous, with the core
becoming glassy above the glass transition temperature while the surface
remains mobile at low temperatures. This helps the clusters sample the highly
stable, low energy structures on the potential energy surface. Our work
suggests the nanocluster systems are structurally more stable than the
ultra-stable glassy thin films, formed through vapor deposition onto a cold
substrate, but the nanoclusters do not exhibit the superheating effects
characteristic of the ultra-stable glass states.
"
21246,The Dayenu Boolean Function Is Almost Always True!,"  The Boolean function implicit in the famous Dayenu song, sung at the Passover
meal, is expressed in full conjunctive normal form, and it is proved that if
there are n miracles the number of truth-vectors satisfying it is $2^n -(n+1)$.
"
21247,Autocalibrating and Calibrationless Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Bilinear Inverse Problem,"  Modern reconstruction methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exploit
the spatially varying sensitivity profiles of receive-coil arrays as additional
source of information. This allows to reduce the number of time-consuming
Fourier-encoding steps by undersampling. The receive sensitivities are a priori
unknown and influenced by geometry and electric properties of the (moving)
subject. For optimal results, they need to be estimated jointly with the image
from the same undersampled measurement data. Formulated as an inverse problem,
this leads to a bilinear reconstruction problem related to multi-channel blind
deconvolution. In this work, we will discuss some recently developed approaches
for the solution of this problem.
"
21248,"Friend, Collaborator, Student, Manager: How Design of an AI-Driven Game Level Editor Affects Creators","  Machine learning advances have afforded an increase in algorithms capable of
creating art, music, stories, games, and more. However, it is not yet
well-understood how machine learning algorithms might best collaborate with
people to support creative expression. To investigate how practicing designers
perceive the role of AI in the creative process, we developed a game level
design tool for Super Mario Bros.-style games with a built-in AI level
designer. In this paper we discuss our design of the Morai Maker intelligent
tool through two mixed-methods studies with a total of over one-hundred
participants. Our findings are as follows: (1) level designers vary in their
desired interactions with, and role of, the AI, (2) the AI prompted the level
designers to alter their design practices, and (3) the level designers
perceived the AI as having potential value in their design practice, varying
based on their desired role for the AI.
"
21249,Approximation Algorithms for Barrier Sweep Coverage,"  Time-varying coverage, namely sweep coverage is a recent development in the
area of wireless sensor networks, where a small number of mobile sensors sweep
or monitor comparatively large number of locations periodically. In this
article we study barrier sweep coverage with mobile sensors where the barrier
is considered as a finite length continuous curve on a plane. The coverage at
every point on the curve is time-variant. We propose an optimal solution for
sweep coverage of a finite length continuous curve. Usually energy source of a
mobile sensor is battery with limited power, so energy restricted sweep
coverage is a challenging problem for long running applications. We propose an
energy restricted sweep coverage problem where every mobile sensors must visit
an energy source frequently to recharge or replace its battery. We propose a
$\frac{13}{3}$-approximation algorithm for this problem. The proposed algorithm
for multiple curves achieves the best possible approximation factor 2 for a
special case. We propose a 5-approximation algorithm for the general problem.
As an application of the barrier sweep coverage problem for a set of line
segments, we formulate a data gathering problem. In this problem a set of
mobile sensors is arbitrarily monitoring the line segments one for each. A set
of data mules periodically collects the monitoring data from the set of mobile
sensors. We prove that finding the minimum number of data mules to collect data
periodically from every mobile sensor is NP-hard and propose a 3-approximation
algorithm to solve it.
"
21250,Reinforcement Learning via Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks,"  Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the learning of policies for complex
tasks in partially observable environments, without explicitly learning the
underlying model of the tasks. While such model-free methods achieve
considerable performance, they often ignore the structure of task. We present a
natural representation of to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems using
Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), to better exploit this
inherent structure. We define 3 such RCNNs, whose forward passes execute an
efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable
environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Backpropagating
gradients through these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the
Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP,
serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the
proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We
demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of replanning,
learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learnt models to achieve
near-optimal policies.
"
21251,Evaluating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Material Classification,"  Determining the material category of a surface from an image is a demanding
task in perception that is drawing increasing attention. Following the recent
remarkable results achieved for image classification and object detection
utilising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we empirically study material
classification of everyday objects employing these techniques. More
specifically, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of how state-of-the art CNN
architectures compare on a common ground over widely used material databases.
Experimental results on three challenging material databases show that the best
performing CNN architectures can achieve up to 94.99\% mean average precision
when classifying materials.
"
21252,Localization of JPEG double compression through multi-domain convolutional neural networks,"  When an attacker wants to falsify an image, in most of cases she/he will
perform a JPEG recompression. Different techniques have been developed based on
diverse theoretical assumptions but very effective solutions have not been
developed yet. Recently, machine learning based approaches have been started to
appear in the field of image forensics to solve diverse tasks such as
acquisition source identification and forgery detection. In this last case, the
aim ahead would be to get a trained neural network able, given a to-be-checked
image, to reliably localize the forged areas. With this in mind, our paper
proposes a step forward in this direction by analyzing how a single or double
JPEG compression can be revealed and localized using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Different kinds of input to the CNN have been taken into
consideration, and various experiments have been carried out trying also to
evidence potential issues to be further investigated.
"
21253,From CDF to PDF --- A Density Estimation Method for High Dimensional Data,"  CDF2PDF is a method of PDF estimation by approximating CDF. The original idea
of it was previously proposed in [1] called SIC. However, SIC requires
additional hyper-parameter tunning, and no algorithms for computing higher
order derivative from a trained NN are provided in [1]. CDF2PDF improves SIC by
avoiding the time-consuming hyper-parameter tuning part and enabling higher
order derivative computation to be done in polynomial time. Experiments of this
method for one-dimensional data shows promising results.
"
21254,Spectrally-normalized margin bounds for neural networks,"  This paper presents a margin-based multiclass generalization bound for neural
networks that scales with their margin-normalized ""spectral complexity"": their
Lipschitz constant, meaning the product of the spectral norms of the weight
matrices, times a certain correction factor. This bound is empirically
investigated for a standard AlexNet network trained with SGD on the mnist and
cifar10 datasets, with both original and random labels; the bound, the
Lipschitz constants, and the excess risks are all in direct correlation,
suggesting both that SGD selects predictors whose complexity scales with the
difficulty of the learning task, and secondly that the presented bound is
sensitive to this complexity.
"
21255,Fully Coupled Simulation of Cosmic Reionization. III. Stochastic Early Reionization by the Smallest Galaxies,"  Previously we identified a new class of early galaxy that we estimate
contributes up to 30\% of the ionizing photons responsible for reionization.
These are low mass halos in the range $M_h =10^{6.5}-10^{8} M_{\odot}$ that
have been chemically enriched by supernova ejecta from prior Pop III star
formation. Despite their low star formation rates, these Metal Cooling halos
(MCs) are significant sources of ionizing radiation, especially at the onset of
reionization, due to their high number density and ionizing escape fractions.
Here we present a fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamic simulation of
reionization that includes these MCs as well the more massive hydrogen atomic
line cooling halos. Our method is novel: we perform halo finding inline with
the radiation hydrodynamical simulation, and assign escaping ionizing fluxes to
halos using a probability distribution function (PDF) measured from the
galaxy-resolving Renaissance Simulations. The PDF captures the mass dependence
of the ionizing escape fraction as well as the probability that a halo is
actively forming stars. With MCs, reionization starts earlier than if only
halos of $10^8 M_{\odot}$ and above are included, however the redshift when
reionization completes is only marginally affected as this is driven by more
massive galaxies. Because star formation is intermittent in MCs, the earliest
phase of reionization exhibits a stochastic nature, with small H II regions
forming and recombining. Only later, once halos of mass $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$
and above begin to dominate the ionizing emissivity, does reionization proceed
smoothly in the usual manner deduced from previous studies. This occurs at
$z\approx 10$ in our simulation.
"
21256,Open Source Dataset and Deep Learning Models for Online Digit Gesture Recognition on Touchscreens,"  This paper presents an evaluation of deep neural networks for recognition of
digits entered by users on a smartphone touchscreen. A new large dataset of
Arabic numerals was collected for training and evaluation of the network. The
dataset consists of spatial and temporal touch data recorded for 80 digits
entered by 260 users. Two neural network models were investigated. The first
model was a 2D convolutional neural (ConvNet) network applied to bitmaps of the
glpyhs created by interpolation of the sensed screen touches and its topology
is similar to that of previously published models for offline handwriting
recognition from scanned images. The second model used a 1D ConvNet
architecture but was applied to the sequence of polar vectors connecting the
touch points. The models were found to provide accuracies of 98.50% and 95.86%,
respectively. The second model was much simpler, providing a reduction in the
number of parameters from 1,663,370 to 287,690. The dataset has been made
available to the community as an open source resource.
"
21257,On Counting Perfect Matchings in General Graphs,"  Counting perfect matchings has played a central role in the theory of
counting problems. The permanent, corresponding to bipartite graphs, was shown
to be #P-complete to compute exactly by Valiant (1979), and a fully polynomial
randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) was presented by Jerrum, Sinclair, and
Vigoda (2004) using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. However, it has
remained an open question whether there exists an FPRAS for counting perfect
matchings in general graphs. In fact, it was unresolved whether the same Markov
chain defined by JSV is rapidly mixing in general. In this paper, we show that
it is not. We prove torpid mixing for any weighting scheme on hole patterns in
the JSV chain. As a first step toward overcoming this obstacle, we introduce a
new algorithm for counting matchings based on the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition
of a graph, and give an FPRAS for counting matchings in graphs that are
sufficiently close to bipartite. In particular, we obtain a fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm for counting matchings in general graphs, parameterized by
the greatest ""order"" of a factor-critical subgraph.
"
21258,Density and spin modes in imbalanced normal Fermi gases from collisionless to hydrodynamic regime,"  We study mass and population imbalance effect on density (in-phase) and spin
(out-of-phase) collective modes in a two-component normal Fermi gas. By
calculating eigenmodes of the linearized Boltzmann equation as well as the
density/spin dynamic structure factor, we show that mass and population
imbalance effects offer a variety of collective mode crossover behaviors from
collisionless to hydrodynamic regimes. The mass imbalance effect shifts the
crossover regime to the higher-temperature, and a significant peak of the spin
dynamic structure factor emerges only in the collisionless regime. This is in
contrast to the case of mass and population balanced normal Fermi gases, where
the spin dynamic response is always absent. Although the population imbalance
effect does not shift the crossover regime, the spin dynamic structure factor
survives both in the collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes.
"
21259,Bounds on parameters of minimally non-linear patterns,"  Let $ex(n, P)$ be the maximum possible number of ones in any 0-1 matrix of
dimensions $n \times n$ that avoids $P$. Matrix $P$ is called minimally
non-linear if $ex(n, P) = \omega(n)$ but $ex(n, P') = O(n)$ for every strict
subpattern $P'$ of $P$. We prove that the ratio between the length and width of
any minimally non-linear 0-1 matrix is at most $4$, and that a minimally
non-linear 0-1 matrix with $k$ rows has at most $5k-3$ ones. We also obtain an
upper bound on the number of minimally non-linear 0-1 matrices with $k$ rows.
In addition, we prove corresponding bounds for minimally non-linear ordered
graphs. The minimal non-linearity that we investigate for ordered graphs is for
the extremal function $ex_{<}(n, G)$, which is the maximum possible number of
edges in any ordered graph on $n$ vertices with no ordered subgraph isomorphic
to $G$.
"
21260,The sum of multidimensional divisor function over values of quadratic polynomial,"  Let $F({\bf x})={\bf x}^tQ_m{\bf x}+\mathbf{b}^t{\bf x}+c\in\mathbb{Z}[{\bf
x}]$ be a quadratic polynomial in $\ell (\ge 3 )$ variables ${\bf x}
=(x_{1},...,x_{\ell})$, where $F({\bf x})$ is positive when ${\bf
x}\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 1}^{\ell}$, $Q_m\in {\rm M}_{\ell}(\mathbb{Z})$ is an
$\ell\times\ell$ matrix and its discriminant $\det\left(Q_m^t+Q_m\right)\neq
0$. It gives explicit asymptotic formulas for the following sum \[
T_{k,F}(X)=\sum_{{\bf x}\in
[1,X]^{\ell}\cap\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}}\tau_{k}\left(F({\bf x})\right) \] with the
help of the circle method. Here
$\tau_{k}(n)=\#\{(x_1,x_2,...,x_{k})\in\mathbb{N}^{k}: n=x_1x_2...x_{k}\}$ with
$k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$ is the multidimensional divisor function.
"
21261,Blazhko effect in the Galactic bulge fundamental mode RR~Lyrae stars I: Incidence rate and differences between modulated and non-modulated stars,"  We present the first paper of a series focused on the Blazhko effect in RR
Lyrae type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode, that are located in the
Galactic bulge. A~comprehensive overview about the incidence rate and
light-curve characteristics of the Blazhko stars is given. We analysed 8\,282
stars having the best quality data in the OGLE-IV survey, and found that at
least $40.3$\,\% of stars show modulation of their light curves. The number of
Blazhko stars we identified is 3\,341, which is the largest sample ever studied
implying the most relevant statistical results currently available. Using
combined data sets with OGLE-III observations, we found that 50\,\% of stars
that show unresolved close peaks to the main component in OGLE-IV are actually
Blazhko stars with extremely long periods. Blazhko stars with modulation occur
preferentially among RR Lyrae stars with shorter pulsation periods in the
Galactic bulge. Fourier amplitude and phase coefficients based on the mean
light curves appear to be substantially lower for Blazhko stars than for stars
with unmodulated light curve in average. We derived new relations for the
compatibility parameter $D_{m}$ in $I$ passband and relations that allow for
differentiating modulated and non-modulated stars easily on the basis of
$R_{31}$, $\phi_{21}$ and $\phi_{31}$. Photometric metallicities, intrinsic
colours and absolute magnitudes computed using empirical relations are the same
for Blazhko and non-modulated stars in the Galactic bulge suggesting no
correlation between the occurrence of the Blazhko effect and these parameters.
"
21262,Radiation damage and thermal shock response of carbon-fiber-reinforced materials to intense high-energy proton beams,"  A comprehensive study on the effects of energetic protons on carbon-fiber
composites and compounds under consideration for use as low-Z pion production
targets in future high-power accelerators and low-impedance collimating
elements for intercepting TeV-level protons at the Large Hadron Collider has
been undertaken addressing two key areas, namely, thermal shock absorption and
resistance to irradiation damage.
"
21263,Common greedy wiring and rewiring heuristics do not guarantee maximum assortative graphs of given degree,"  We examine two greedy heuristics - wiring and rewiring - for constructing
maximum assortative graphs over all simple connected graphs with a target
degree sequence. Counterexamples show that natural greedy rewiring heuristics
do not necessarily return a maximum assortative graph, even though it is known
that the meta-graph of all simple connected graphs with given degree is
connected under rewiring. Counterexamples show an elegant greedy graph wiring
heuristic from the literature may fail to achieve the target degree sequence or
may fail to wire a maximally assortative graph.
"
21264,Electromagnetically Induced Transparency with Superradiant and Subradiant states,"  We construct the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) by
dynamically coupling a superradiant state with a subradiant state. The
superradiant and subradiant states with enhanced and inhibited decay rates act
as the excited and metastable states in EIT, respectively. Their energy
difference determined by the distance between the atoms can be measured by the
EIT spectra, which renders this method useful in subwavelength metrology. The
scheme can also be applied to many atoms in nuclear quantum optics, where the
transparency point due to counter-rotating wave terms can be observed.
"
21265,Highly efficient angularly resolving x-ray spectrometer optimized for absorption measurements with collimated sources,"  Highly collimated betatron radiation from a laser wakefield accelerator is a
promising tool for spectroscopic measurements. Therefore there is a requirement
to create spectrometers suited to the unique properties of such a source. We
demonstrate a spectrometer which achieves an energy resolution of < 5 eV at 9
keV and is angularly resolving the x-ray emission allowing the reference and
spectrum to be recorded at the same time. The single photon analysis is used to
significantly reduce the background noise. Theoretical performance of various
configurations of the spectrometer is calculated by a ray-tracing algorithm.
The properties and performance of the spectrometer including the angular and
spectral resolution are demonstrated experimentally on absorption above the
K-edge of a Cu foil backlit by laser-produced betatron radiation x-ray beam.
"
21266,Assessing the impact of non-vaccinators: quantifying the average length of infection chains in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease,"  Analytical expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, have been
obtained in the past for a wide variety of mathematical models for infectious
disease spread, along with expressions for the expected final size of an
outbreak. However, what has so far not been studied is the average number of
infections that descend down the chains of infection begun by each of the
individuals infected in an outbreak (we refer to this quantity as the ""average
number of descendant infections"" per infectious individual, or ANDI). ANDI
includes not only the number of people that an individual directly contacts and
infects, but also the number of people that those go on to infect, and so on
until that particular chain of infection dies out. Quantification of ANDI has
relevance to the vaccination debate, since with ANDI one can calculate the
probability that one or more people are hospitalised (or die) from a disease
down an average chain of infection descending from an infected un-vaccinated
individual. Here we obtain estimates of ANDI using both deterministic and
stochastic modelling formalisms. With both formalisms we find that even for
relatively small community sizes and under most scenarios for R0 and initial
fraction vaccinated, ANDI can be surprisingly large when the effective
reproduction number is >1, leading to high probabilities of adverse outcomes
for one or more people down an average chain of infection in outbreaks of
diseases like measles.
"
21267,A Framework and Comparative Analysis of Control Plane Security of SDN and Conventional Networks,"  Software defined networking implements the network control plane in an
external entity, rather than in each individual device as in conventional
networks. This architectural difference implies a different design for control
functions necessary for essential network properties, e.g., loop prevention and
link redundancy. We explore how such differences redefine the security
weaknesses in the SDN control plane and provide a framework for comparative
analysis which focuses on essential network properties required by typical
production networks. This enables analysis of how these properties are
delivered by the control planes of SDN and conventional networks, and to
compare security risks and mitigations. Despite the architectural difference,
we find similar, but not identical, exposures in control plane security if both
network paradigms provide the same network properties and are analyzed under
the same threat model. However, defenses vary; SDN cannot depend on edge based
filtering to protect its control plane, while this is arguably the primary
defense in conventional networks. Our concrete security analysis suggests that
a distributed SDN architecture that supports fault tolerance and consistency
checks is important for SDN control plane security. Our analysis methodology
may be of independent interest for future security analysis of SDN and
conventional networks.
"
21268,Relative homological algebra via truncations,"  To do homological algebra with unbounded chain complexes one needs to first
find a way of constructing resolutions. Spaltenstein solved this problem for
chain complexes of R-modules by truncating further and further to the left,
resolving the pieces, and gluing back the partial resolutions. Our aim is to
give a homotopy theoretical interpretation of this procedure, which may be
extended to a relative setting. We work in an arbitrary abelian category A and
fix a class I of ""injective objects"". We show that Spaltenstein's construction
can be captured by a pair of adjoint functors between unbounded chain complexes
and towers of non-positively graded ones. This pair of adjoint functors forms
what we call a Quillen pair and the above process of truncations, partial
resolutions, and gluing, gives a meaningful way to resolve complexes in a
relative setting up to a split error term. In order to do homotopy theory, and
in particular to construct a well behaved relative derived category D(A; I), we
need more: the split error term must vanish. This is the case when I is the
class of all injective R-modules but not in general, not even for certain
classes of injectives modules over a Noetherian ring. The key property is a
relative analogue of Roos's AB4*-n axiom for abelian categories. Various
concrete examples such as Gorenstein homological algebra and purity are also
discussed.

21269,Note: A pairwise form of the Ewald sum for non-neutral systems,"  Using an example of a mixed discrete-continuum representation of charges
under the periodic boundary condition, we show that the exact pairwise form of
the Ewald sum, which is well-defined even if the system is non-neutral,
provides a natural starting point for deriving unambiguous Coulomb energies
that must remove all spurious dependence on the choice of the Ewald screening
factor.
"
21270,Model selection and model averaging in MACML-estimated MNP models,"  This paper provides a review of model selection and model averaging methods
for multinomial probit models estimated using the MACML approach. The proposed
approaches are partitioned into test based methods (mostly derived from the
likelihood ratio paradigm), methods based on information criteria and model
averaging methods.
Many of the approaches first have been derived for models estimated using
maximum likelihood and later adapted to the composite marginal likelihood
framework. In this paper all approaches are applied to the MACML approach for
estimation. The investigation lists advantages and disadvantages of the various
methods in terms of asymptotic properties as well as computational aspects. We
find that likelihood-ratio-type tests and information criteria have a spotty
performance when applied to MACML models and instead propose the use of an
empirical likelihood test.
Furthermore, we show that model averaging is easily adaptable to CML
estimation and has promising performance w.r.t to parameter recovery. Finally
model averaging is applied to a real world example in order to demonstrate the
feasibility of the method in real world sized problems.
"
21271,Fuzzy Ontology-Based Sentiment Analysis of Transportation and City Feature Reviews for Safe Traveling,"  Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega
cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this
problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of
monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services
when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to
quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these
existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating
scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.).
These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information,
whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and
transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However,
it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to
process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the
needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing
the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment
analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract
blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate
results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment
analysis and SWRL rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation
activities and to make a city- feature polarity map for travelers. This system
retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation
activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and
then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature
polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by
using Protégé OWL and Java, respectively.
"
21272,On the Gap Between Strict-Saddles and True Convexity: An Omega(log d) Lower Bound for Eigenvector Approximation,"  We prove a \emph{query complexity} lower bound on rank-one principal
component analysis (PCA). We consider an oracle model where, given a symmetric
matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, an algorithm is allowed to make $T$
\emph{exact} queries of the form $w^{(i)} = Mv^{(i)}$ for $i \in
\{1,\dots,T\}$, where $v^{(i)}$ is drawn from a distribution which depends
arbitrarily on the past queries and measurements $\{v^{(j)},w^{(j)}\}_{1 \le j
\le i-1}$. We show that for a small constant $\epsilon$, any adaptive,
randomized algorithm which can find a unit vector $\widehat{v}$ for which
$\widehat{v}^{\top}M\widehat{v} \ge (1-\epsilon)\|M\|$, with even small
probability, must make $T = \Omega(\log d)$ queries. In addition to settling a
widely-held folk conjecture, this bound demonstrates a fundamental gap between
convex optimization and ""strict-saddle"" non-convex optimization of which PCA is
a canonical example: in the former, first-order methods can have dimension-free
iteration complexity, whereas in PCA, the iteration complexity of
gradient-based methods must necessarily grow with the dimension. Our argument
proceeds via a reduction to estimating the rank-one spike in a deformed Wigner
model. We establish lower bounds for this model by developing a ""truncated""
analogue of the $\chi^2$ Bayes-risk lower bound of Chen et al.
"
21273,A Predictive Approach Using Deep Feature Learning for Electronic Medical Records: A Comparative Study,"  Massive amount of electronic medical records accumulating from patients and
populations motivates clinicians and data scientists to collaborate for the
advanced analytics to extract knowledge that is essential to address the
extensive personalized insights needed for patients, clinicians, providers,
scientists, and health policy makers. In this paper, we propose a new
predictive approach based on feature representation using deep feature learning
and word embedding techniques. Our method uses different deep architectures for
feature representation in higher-level abstraction to obtain effective and more
robust features from EMRs, and then build prediction models on the top of them.
Our approach is particularly useful when the unlabeled data is abundant whereas
labeled one is scarce. We investigate the performance of representation
learning through a supervised approach. First, we apply our method on a small
dataset related to a specific precision medicine problem, which focuses on
prediction of left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVMI) as an
indicator of heart damage risk in a vulnerable demographic subgroup
(African-Americans). Then we use two large datasets from eICU collaborative
research database to predict the length of stay in Cardiac-ICU and Neuro-ICU
based on high dimensional features. Finally we provide a comparative study and
show that our predictive approach leads to better results in comparison with
others.
"
21274,Gelfand numbers related to structured sparsity and Besov space embeddings with small mixed smoothness,"  We consider the problem of determining the asymptotic order of the Gelfand
numbers of mixed-(quasi-)norm embeddings $\ell^b_p(\ell^d_q) \hookrightarrow
\ell^b_r(\ell^d_u)$ given that $p \leq r$ and $q \leq u$, with emphasis on
cases with $p\leq 1$ and/or $q\leq 1$. These cases turn out to be related to
structured sparsity. We obtain sharp bounds in a number of interesting
parameter constellations. Our new matching bounds for the Gelfand numbers of
the embeddings of $\ell_1^b(\ell_2^d)$ and $\ell_2^b(\ell_1^d)$ into
$\ell_2^b(\ell_2^d)$ imply optimality assertions for the recovery of
block-sparse and sparse-in-levels vectors, respectively. In addition, we apply
the sharp estimates for $\ell^b_p(\ell^d_q)$-spaces to obtain new two-sided
estimates for the Gelfand numbers of multivariate Besov space embeddings in
regimes of small mixed smoothness. It turns out that in some particular cases
these estimates show the same asymptotic behaviour as in the univariate
situation. In the remaining cases they differ at most by a $\log\log$ factor
from the univariate bound.
"
21275,"Dust attenuation, bulge formation and inside-out cessation of star-formation in Star-Forming Main Sequence galaxies at z~2","  We derive two-dimensional dust attenuation maps at $\sim1~\mathrm{kpc}$
resolution from the UV continuum for ten galaxies on the $z\sim2$ Star-Forming
Main Sequence (SFMS). Comparison with IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies
do not require further obscuration in addition to the UV-based correction,
though our sample does not include the most heavily obscured, massive galaxies.
The individual rest-frame $V$-band dust attenuation (A$_{\rm V}$) radial
profiles scatter around an average profile that gently decreases from $\sim1.8$
mag in the center down to $\sim0.6$ mag at $\sim3-4$ half-mass radii. We use
these maps to correct UV- and H$\alpha$-based star-formation rates (SFRs),
which agree with each other. At masses $<10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the
dust-corrected specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at
a mass-doubling timescale of $\sim300~\mathrm{Myr}$, pointing at a synchronous
growth of bulge and disk components. At masses $>10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the sSFR
profiles are typically centrally-suppressed by a factor of $\sim10$ relative to
the galaxy outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates
that at least a fraction of massive $z\sim2$ SFMS galaxies have started their
inside-out star-formation quenching that will move them to the quenched
sequence. In combination with other observations, galaxies above and below the
ridge of the SFMS relation have respectively centrally-enhanced and
centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture
where bulges are built due to gas `compaction' that leads to a high central SFR
as galaxies move towards the upper envelope of SFMS.
"
21276,Shannon Shakes Hands with Chernoff: Big Data Viewpoint On Channel Information Measures,"  Shannon entropy is the most crucial foundation of Information Theory, which
has been proven to be effective in many fields such as communications. Renyi
entropy and Chernoff information are other two popular measures of information
with wide applications. The mutual information is effective to measure the
channel information for the fact that it reflects the relation between output
variables and input variables. In this paper, we reexamine these channel
information measures in big data viewpoint by means of ACE algorithm. The
simulated results show us that decomposition results of Shannon and Chernoff
mutual information with respect to channel parametersare almost the same. In
this sense, Shannon shakes hands with Chernoff since they are different
measures of the same information quantity. We also propose a conjecture that
there is nature of channel information which is only decided by the channel
parameters.
"
21277,A Morse theoretic description of the Goresky-Hingston product,"  The Goresky-Hingston coproduct was first introduced by D. Sullivan and later
extended by M. Goresky and N. Hingston. In this article we give a Morse
theoretic description of the coproduct. Using the description we prove homotopy
invariance property of the coproduct. We describe a connection between our
Morse theoretic coproduct and a coproduct on Floer homology of cotangent
bundle.
"
21278,SoAx: A generic C++ Structure of Arrays for handling Particles in HPC Codes,"  The numerical study of physical problems often require integrating the
dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of
equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying
such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two
different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing
(HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of
the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information
is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure)
represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In
contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure
holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of
the whole set of particles.
The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and
flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance
of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our
particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon
processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the
AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor
of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and
multi-purpose GPUs.
Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has
optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same
handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such
template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user
defined heterogeneous data structures.
"
21279,Multi-scenario deep learning for multi-speaker source separation,"  Research in deep learning for multi-speaker source separation has received a
boost in the last years. However, most studies are restricted to mixtures of a
specific number of speakers, called a specific scenario. While some works
included experiments for different scenarios, research towards combining data
of different scenarios or creating a single model for multiple scenarios have
been very rare. In this work it is shown that data of a specific scenario is
relevant for solving another scenario. Furthermore, it is concluded that a
single model, trained on different scenarios is capable of matching performance
of scenario specific models.
"
21280,Strongly mixed random errors in Mann's iteration algorithm for a contractive real function,"  This work deals with the Mann's stochastic iteration algorithm under strong
mixing random errors. We establish the Fuk-Nagaev's inequalities that enable us
to prove the almost complete convergence with its corresponding rate of
convergence. Moreover, these inequalities give us the possibility of
constructing a confidence interval for the unique fixed point. Finally, to
check the feasibility and validity of our theoretical results, we consider some
numerical examples, namely a classical example from astronomy.
"
21281,Attribution Modeling Increases Efficiency of Bidding in Display Advertising,"  Predicting click and conversion probabilities when bidding on ad exchanges is
at the core of the programmatic advertising industry. Two separated lines of
previous works respectively address i) the prediction of user conversion
probability and ii) the attribution of these conversions to advertising events
(such as clicks) after the fact. We argue that attribution modeling improves
the efficiency of the bidding policy in the context of performance advertising.
Firstly we explain the inefficiency of the standard bidding policy with respect
to attribution. Secondly we learn and utilize an attribution model in the
bidder itself and show how it modifies the average bid after a click. Finally
we produce evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method on both offline
and online experiments with data spanning several weeks of real traffic from
Criteo, a leader in performance advertising.
"
21282,Identifying high betweenness centrality nodes in large social networks,"  This paper proposes an alternative way to identify nodes with high
betweenness centrality. It introduces a new metric, k-path centrality, and a
randomized algorithm for estimating it, and shows empirically that nodes with
high k-path centrality have high node betweenness centrality. The randomized
algorithm runs in time $O(\kappa^{3}n^{2-2\alpha}\log n)$ and outputs, for each
vertex v, an estimate of its k-path centrality up to additive error of $\pm
n^{1/2+ \alpha}$ with probability $1-1/n^2$. Experimental evaluations on real
and synthetic social networks show improved accuracy in detecting high
betweenness centrality nodes and significantly reduced execution time when
compared with existing randomized algorithms.
"
21283,A functional limit theorem for the sine-process,"  The main result of this paper is a functional limit theorem for the
sine-process. In particular, we study the limit distribution, in the space of
trajectories, for the number of particles in a growing interval. The
sine-process has the Kolmogorov property and satisfies the Central Limit
Theorem, but our functional limit theorem is very different from the Donsker
Invariance Principle. We show that the time integral of our process can be
approximated by the sum of a linear Gaussian process and independent Gaussian
fluctuations whose covariance matrix is computed explicitly. We interpret these
results in terms of the Gaussian Free Field convergence for the random matrix
models. The proof relies on a general form of the multidimensional Central
Limit Theorem under the sine-process for linear statistics of two types: those
having growing variance and those with bounded variance corresponding to
observables of Sobolev regularity $1/2$.
"
21284,Multi-scale Lipschitz percolation of increasing events for Poisson random walks,"  Consider the graph induced by $\mathbb{Z}^d$, equipped with uniformly
elliptic random conductances. At time $0$, place a Poisson point process of
particles on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and let them perform independent simple random
walks. Tessellate the graph into cubes indexed by $i\in\mathbb{Z}^d$ and
tessellate time into intervals indexed by $\tau$. Given a local event
$E(i,\tau)$ that depends only on the particles inside the space time region
given by the cube $i$ and the time interval $\tau$, we prove the existence of a
Lipschitz connected surface of cells $(i,\tau)$ that separates the origin from
infinity on which $E(i,\tau)$ holds. This gives a directly applicable and
robust framework for proving results in this setting that need a multi-scale
argument. For example, this allows us to prove that an infection spreads with
positive speed among the particles.
"
21285,The Planck numbers and the essence of gravitation: phenomenology,"  We introduce phenomenological understanding of the electromagnetic component
of the physical vacuum, the EM vacuum, as a basic medium for all masses of the
expanding Universe, and ""Casimir polarization"" of this medium arising in the
vicinity of any material object in the Universe as a result of conjugation of
the electric field components of the EM vacuum on both sides (""external"" and
""internal"") of atomic nucleus boundary of the each mass with vacuum. It is
shown that the gravitational attraction of two material objects in accordance
with Newton's law of gravity arises as a result of overlapping of the domains
of the EM vacuum Casimir polarization created by atomic nuclei of the objects,
taking into account the long-range gravitational influence of all masses of the
Universe on each nucleus of these objects (Mach's idea). Newton's law of
gravitational attraction between two bodies is generalized to the case of
gravitational interaction of a system of bodies when the center of mass of the
pair of bodies shifted relative to the center of mass of the system. The unique
smallness of gravitational interactions as compared with the fundamental
nuclear (strong and weak) and electromagnetic ones is determined by the ratio
of the characteristic size of the domain of EM vacuum Casimir polarization in
the vicinity of atomic nuclei to the Hubble radius of the Universe.
"
21286,Low-Dimensional Spatial Embedding Method for Shape Uncertainty Quantification in Acoustic Scattering,"  This paper introduces a novel boundary integral approach of shape uncertainty
quantification for the Helmholtz scattering problem in the framework of the
so-called parametric method. The key idea is to construct an integration grid
whose associated weight function encompasses the irregularities and
nonsmoothness imposed by the random boundary. Thus, the solution can be
evaluated accurately with relatively low number of grid points. The integration
grid is obtained by employing a low-dimensional spatial embedding using the
coarea formula. The proposed method can handle large variation as well as
non-smoothness of the random boundary. For the ease of presentation the theory
is restricted to star-shaped obstacles in low-dimensional setting. Higher
spatial and parametric dimensional cases are discussed, though, not extensively
explored in the current study.
"
21287,Updates on the background estimates for the X-IFU instrument onboard of the ATHENA mission,"  ATHENA, with a launch foreseen in 2028 towards the L2 orbit, addresses the
science theme ""The Hot and Energetic Universe"", coupling a high-performance
X-ray Telescope with two complementary focal-plane instruments. One of these,
the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is a TES based kilo-pixel array providing
spatially resolved high-resolution spectroscopy (2.5 eV at 6 keV) over a 5
arcmin FoV. The background for this kind of detectors accounts for several
components: the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background, the low energy particles
(<~100 keV) focalized by the mirrors and reaching the detector from inside the
field of view, and the high energy particles (>~100 MeV) crossing the
spacecraft and reaching the focal plane from every direction. Each one of these
components is under study to reduce their impact on the instrumental
performances. This task is particularly challenging, given the lack of data on
the background of X-ray detectors in L2, the uncertainties on the particle
environment to be expected in such orbit, and the reliability of the models
used in the Monte Carlo background computations. As a consequence, the
activities addressed by the group range from the reanalysis of the data of
previous missions like XMM-Newton, to the characterization of the L2
environment by data analysis of the particle monitors onboard of satellites
present in the Earth magnetotail, to the characterization of solar events and
their occurrence, and to the validation of the physical models involved in the
Monte Carlo simulations. All these activities will allow to develop a set of
reliable simulations to predict, analyze and find effective solutions to reduce
the particle background experienced by the X-IFU, ultimately satisfying the
scientific requirement that enables the science of ATHENA. While the activities
are still ongoing, we present here some preliminary results already obtained by
the group.
"
21288,Galaxy Zoo: star-formation versus spiral arm number,"  Spiral arms are common features in low-redshift disc galaxies, and are
prominent sites of star-formation and dust obscuration. However, spiral
structure can take many forms: from galaxies displaying two strong `grand
design' arms, to those with many `flocculent' arms. We investigate how these
different arm types are related to a galaxy's star-formation and gas properties
by making use of visual spiral arm number measurements from Galaxy Zoo 2. We
combine UV and mid-IR photometry from GALEX and WISE to measure the rates and
relative fractions of obscured and unobscured star formation in a sample of
low-redshift SDSS spirals. Total star formation rate has little dependence on
spiral arm multiplicity, but two-armed spirals convert their gas to stars more
efficiently. We find significant differences in the fraction of obscured
star-formation: an additional $\sim 10$ per cent of star-formation in two-armed
galaxies is identified via mid-IR dust emission, compared to that in many-armed
galaxies. The latter are also significantly offset below the IRX-$\beta$
relation for low-redshift star-forming galaxies. We present several
explanations for these differences versus arm number: variations in the spatial
distribution, sizes or clearing timescales of star-forming regions (i.e.,
molecular clouds), or contrasting recent star-formation histories.
"
21289,Dense Associative Memory is Robust to Adversarial Inputs,"  Deep neural networks (DNN) trained in a supervised way suffer from two known
problems. First, the minima of the objective function used in learning
correspond to data points (also known as rubbish examples or fooling images)
that lack semantic similarity with the training data. Second, a clean input can
be changed by a small, and often imperceptible for human vision, perturbation,
so that the resulting deformed input is misclassified by the network. These
findings emphasize the differences between the ways DNN and humans classify
patterns, and raise a question of designing learning algorithms that more
accurately mimic human perception compared to the existing methods.
Our paper examines these questions within the framework of Dense Associative
Memory (DAM) models. These models are defined by the energy function, with
higher order (higher than quadratic) interactions between the neurons. We show
that in the limit when the power of the interaction vertex in the energy
function is sufficiently large, these models have the following three
properties. First, the minima of the objective function are free from rubbish
images, so that each minimum is a semantically meaningful pattern. Second,
artificial patterns poised precisely at the decision boundary look ambiguous to
human subjects and share aspects of both classes that are separated by that
decision boundary. Third, adversarial images constructed by models with small
power of the interaction vertex, which are equivalent to DNN with rectified
linear units (ReLU), fail to transfer to and fool the models with higher order
interactions. This opens up a possibility to use higher order models for
detecting and stopping malicious adversarial attacks. The presented results
suggest that DAM with higher order energy functions are closer to human visual
perception than DNN with ReLUs.
"
21290,The Nature of Turbulence in the LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies,"  We present probability density functions and higher order (skewness and
kurtosis) analyses of the galaxy-wide and spatially-resolved HI column density
distributions in the LITTLE THINGS sample of dwarf irregular galaxies. This
analysis follows that of Burkhart et al. (2010) for the Small Magellanic Cloud.
About 60% of our sample have galaxy-wide values of kurtosis that are similar to
that found for the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a range up to much higher
values, and kurtosis increases with integrated star formation rate. Kurtosis
and skewness were calculated for radial annuli and for a grid of 32 pixel X 32
pixel kernels across each galaxy. For most galaxies, kurtosis correlates with
skewness. For about half of the galaxies, there is a trend of increasing
kurtosis with radius. The range of kurtosis and skewness values is modeled by
small variations in the Mach number close to the sonic limit and by conversion
of HI to molecules at high column density. The maximum HI column densities
decrease with increasing radius in a way that suggests molecules are forming in
the weak field limit, where H_2 formation balances photodissociation in
optically thin gas at the edges of clouds.
"
21291,Degeneration of Trigonal Curves and Solutions of the KP-Hierarchy,"  It is known that soliton solutions of the KP-hierarchy corresponds to
singular rational curves with only ordinary double points. In this paper we
study the degeneration of theta function solutions corresponding to certain
trigonal curves. We show that, when the curves degenerate to singular rational
curves with only ordinary triple points, the solutions tend to some
intermediate solutions between solitons and rational solutions. They are
considered as cerain limits of solitons. The Sato Grassmannian is extensively
used here to study the degeneration of solutions, since it directly connects
solutions of the KP-hierarchy to the defining equations of algebraic curves.We
define a class of solutions in the Wronskian form which contains soliton
solutions as a subclass and prove that, using the Sato Grassmannian, the
degenerate trigonal solutions are connected to those solutions by certain gauge
transformations
"
21292,Blow-up solutions for a Kirchhoff type elliptic equation with trapping potential,"  We study a generalized Kirchhoff type equation with trapping potential. The
existence and blow-up behavior of solutions with normalized L2-norm for this
problem are discussed.
"
21293,Representing Sentences as Low-Rank Subspaces,"  Sentences are important semantic units of natural language. A generic,
distributional representation of sentences that can capture the latent
semantics is beneficial to multiple downstream applications. We observe a
simple geometry of sentences -- the word representations of a given sentence
(on average 10.23 words in all SemEval datasets with a standard deviation 4.84)
roughly lie in a low-rank subspace (roughly, rank 4). Motivated by this
observation, we represent a sentence by the low-rank subspace spanned by its
word vectors. Such an unsupervised representation is empirically validated via
semantic textual similarity tasks on 19 different datasets, where it
outperforms the sophisticated neural network models, including skip-thought
vectors, by 15% on average.
"
21294,Kinetic Energy Density Functionals by Axiomatic Approach,"  An axiomatic approach is herein used to determine the physically acceptable
forms for general $D$-dimensional kinetic energy density functionals (KEDF).
The resulted expansion captures most of the known forms of one-point KEDFs. By
statistically training the KEDF forms on a model problem of non-interacting
kinetic energy in 1D (6 terms only), the mean relative accuracy for 1000
randomly generated potentials is found to be better than the standard KEDF by
several orders of magnitudes. The accuracy improves with the number of occupied
states and was found to be better than $10^{-4}$ for a system with four
occupied states. Furthermore, we show that free fitting of the coefficients
associated with known KEDFs approaches the exactly analytic values. The
presented approach can open a new route to search for physically acceptable
kinetic energy density functionals and provide an essential step towards more
accurate large-scale orbital free density functional theory calculations.
"
21295,Locating Power Flow Solution Space Boundaries: A Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Approach,"  The solution space of any set of power flow equations may contain different
number of real-valued solutions. The boundaries that separate these regions are
referred to as power flow solution space boundaries. Knowledge of these
boundaries is important as they provide a measure for voltage stability.
Traditionally, continuation based methods have been employed to compute these
boundaries on the basis of initial guesses for the solution. However, with
rapid growth of renewable energy sources these boundaries will be increasingly
affected by variable parameters such as penetration levels, locations of the
renewable sources, and voltage set-points, making it difficult to generate an
initial guess that can guarantee all feasible solutions for the power flow
problem. In this paper we solve this problem by applying a numerical polynomial
homotopy based continuation method. The proposed method guarantees to find all
solution boundaries within a given parameter space up to a chosen level of
discretization, independent of any initial guess. Power system operators can
use this computational tool conveniently to plan the penetration levels of
renewable sources at different buses. We illustrate the proposed method through
simulations on 3-bus and 10-bus power system examples with renewable
generation.
"
21296,First principles calculations of the interface properties of amorphous-Al2O3/MoS2 under non-strain and biaxial strain conditions,"  Al2O3 is a potential dielectric material for metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)
devices. Al2O3 films deposited on semiconductors usually exhibit amorphous due
to lattice mismatch. Compared to two-dimensional graphene, MoS2 is a typical
semiconductor, therefore, it has more extensive application. The
amorphous-Al2O3/MoS2 (a-Al2O3/MoS2) interface has attracted people's attention
because of its unique properties. In this paper, the interface behaviors of
a-Al2O3/MoS2 under non-strain and biaxial strain are investigated by first
principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). First of all,
the generation process of a-Al2O3 sample is described, which is calculated by
molecular dynamics and geometric optimization. Then, we introduce the band
alignment method, and calculate band offset of a-Al2O3/MoS2 interface. It is
found that the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO)
change with the number of MoS2 layers. The dependence of leakage current on the
band offset is also illustrated. At last, the band structure of monolayer MoS2
under biaxial strain is discussed. The biaxial strain is set in the range from
-6% to 6% with the interval of 2%. Impact of the biaxial strain on the band
alignment is investigated.
"
21297,On cohomological Hall algebras of quivers : Yangians,"  We consider the cohomological Hall algebra Y of a Lagrangian substack of the
moduli stack of representations of the preprojective algebra of an arbitrary
quiver Q, and its actions on the cohomology of quiver varieties. We conjecture
that Y is equal, after a suitable extension of scalars, to the Yangian
introduced by Maulik and Okounkov, and we construct an embedding of Y in the
Yangian, intertwining the respective actions of both algebras on the cohomology
of quiver varieties.
"
21298,Are Continuum Predictions of Clustering Chaotic?,"  Gas-solid multiphase flows are prone to develop an instability known as
clustering. Two-fluid models, which treat the particulate phase as a continuum,
are known to reproduce the qualitative features of this instability, producing
highly-dynamic, spatiotemporal patterns. However, it is unknown whether such
simulations are truly aperiodic or a type of complex periodic behavior. By
showing that the system possesses a sensitive dependence on initial conditions
and a positive largest Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda_1 \approx 1/\tau$, we
provide a tentative answer: continuum predictions of clustering are chaotic. We
further demonstrate that the chaotic behavior is dimensionally dependent, a
conclusion which unifies previous results and strongly suggests that the
chaotic behavior is not a result of the fundamental kinematic instability, but
of the secondary (inherently multidimensional) instability.
"
21299,Easing Tensions with Quartessence,"  Tensions between cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and the
growth of the large-scale structure (LSS) inferred from late-time probes pose a
serious challenge to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.
State-of-the-art CMB data from the Planck satellite predicts a higher rate of
structure growth than what preferred by low-redshift observables. Such tension
has hitherto eluded conclusive explanations in terms of straightforward
modifications to $\Lambda$CDM, e.g. the inclusion of massive neutrinos or a
dynamical dark energy component. Here, we investigate `quartessence' models,
where a single dark component mimics both dark matter and dark energy. We show
that such models greatly alleviate the tension between high and low redshift
observations, thanks to the non-vanishing sound speed of quartessence that
inhibits structure growth at late times on scales smaller than its
corresponding Jeans' length. In particular, the $3.4\sigma$ tension between CMB
and LSS observables is thoroughly reabsorbed. For this reason, we argue that
quartessence deserves further investigation and may lead to a deeper
understanding of the physics of the dark Universe.

21300,Stable high-pressure phases in the H-S system determined by chemically reacting hydrogen and sulfur,"  Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have been used to study
chemical reactions of molecular hydrogen (H2) with sulfur (S) at high
pressures. We find theoretically predicted Cccm and Im-3m H3S to be the
reaction products at 50 and 140 GPa, respectively. Im-3m H3S is a stable
crystalline phase above 140 GPa and it transforms to R3m H3S on pressure
release below 140 GPa. The latter phase is (meta)stable down to at least 70 GPa
where it transforms to Cccm H3S upon annealing (T<1300 K) to overcome the
kinetic hindrance. Cccm H3S has an extended structure with symmetric hydrogen
bonds at 50 GPa and upon decompression it experiences a transformation to a
molecular mixed H2S-H2 structure below 40 GPa without any apparent change in
the crystal symmetry.
"
21301,Learning Neurosymbolic Generative Models via Program Synthesis,"  Significant strides have been made toward designing better generative models
in recent years. Despite this progress, however, state-of-the-art approaches
are still largely unable to capture complex global structure in data. For
example, images of buildings typically contain spatial patterns such as windows
repeating at regular intervals; state-of-the-art generative methods can't
easily reproduce these structures. We propose to address this problem by
incorporating programs representing global structure into the generative
model---e.g., a 2D for-loop may represent a configuration of windows.
Furthermore, we propose a framework for learning these models by leveraging
program synthesis to generate training data. On both synthetic and real-world
data, we demonstrate that our approach is substantially better than the
state-of-the-art at both generating and completing images that contain global
structure.
"
21302,Collapsibility of marginal models for categorical data,"  We consider marginal log-linear models for parameterizing distributions on
multidimensional contingency tables. These models generalize ordinary
log-linear and multivariate logistic models, besides several others. First, we
obtain some characteristic properties of marginal log-linear parameters. Then
we define collapsibility and strict collapsibility of these parameters in a
general sense. Several necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsibility
and strict collapsibility are derived using the technique of Möbius
inversion. These include results for an arbitrary set of marginal log-linear
parameters having some common effects. The connections of collapsibility and
strict collapsibility to various forms of independence of the variables are
discussed. Finally, we establish a result on the relationship between
parameters with the same effect but different margins, and use it to
demonstrate smoothness of marginal log-linear models under collapsibility
conditions thereby obtaining a curved exponential family.
"
21303,Tunable viscosity modification with diluted particles: When particles decrease the viscosity of complex fluids,"  While spherical particles are the most studied viscosity modifiers, they are
well known only to increase viscosities, in particular at low concentrations.
Extended studies and theories on non-spherical particles find a more
complicated behavior, but still a steady increase. Involving platelets in
combination with complex fluids displays an even more complex scenario that we
analyze experimentally and theoretically as a function of platelet diameter, to
find the underlying concepts. Using a broad toolbox of different techniques we
were able to decrease the viscosity of crude oils although solid particles were
added. This apparent contradiction could lead to a wider range of applications.
"
21304,Research Portfolio Analysis and Topic Prominence,"  Stakeholders in the science system need to decide where to place their bets.
Example questions include: Which areas of research should get more funding? Who
should we hire? Which projects should we abandon and which new projects should
we start? Making informed choices requires knowledge about these research
options. Unfortunately, to date research portfolio options have not been
defined in a consistent, transparent and relevant manner. Furthermore, we don't
know how to define demand for these options. In this article, we address the
issues of consistency, transparency, relevance and demand by using a model of
science consisting of 91,726 topics (or research options) that contain over 58
million documents. We present a new indicator of topic prominence - a measure
of visibility, momentum and, ultimately, demand. We assign over $203 billion of
project-level funding data from STAR METRICS to individual topics in science,
and show that the indicator of topic prominence, explains over one-third of the
variance in current (or future) funding by topic. We also show that highly
prominent topics receive far more funding per researcher than topics that are
not prominent. Implications of these results for research planning and
portfolio analysis by institutions and researchers are emphasized.
"
21305,Un Crit{È}Re Simple,"  In this short note, we mimic the proof of the simplicity of the theory ACFA
of generic difference fields in order to provide a criterion, valid for certain
theories of pure fields and fields equipped with operators, which shows that a
complete theory is simple whenever its definable and algebraic closures are
controlled by an underlying stable theory.
"
21306,Orbits of irreducible binary forms over GF$(p)$,"  In this note I give a formula for calculating the number of orbits of
irreducible binary forms of degree $n$ over GF$(p)$ under the action of
GL$(2,p)$. This formula has applications to the classification of class two
groups of exponent $p$ with derived groups of order $p^2$.
"
21307,A Survey of Entorhinal Grid Cell Properties,"  About a decade ago grid cells were discovered in the medial entorhinal cortex
of rat. Their peculiar firing patterns, which correlate with periodic locations
in the environment, led to early hypothesis that grid cells may provide some
form of metric for space. Subsequent research has since uncovered a wealth of
new insights into the characteristics of grid cells and their neural
neighborhood, the parahippocampal-hippocampal region, calling for a revision
and refinement of earlier grid cell models. This survey paper aims to provide a
comprehensive summary of grid cell research published in the past decade. It
focuses on the functional characteristics of grid cells such as the influence
of external cues or the alignment to environmental geometry, but also provides
a basic overview of the underlying neural substrate.
"
21308,An Automata-based Abstract Semantics for String Manipulation Languages,"  In recent years, dynamic languages, such as JavaScript or Python, have faced
an important increment of usage in a wide range of fields and applications.
Their tricky and misunderstood behaviors pose a hard challenge for static
analysis of these programming languages. A key aspect of any dynamic language
program is the multiple usage of strings, since they can be implicitly
converted to another type value, transformed by string-to-code primitives or
used to access an object-property. Unfortunately, string analyses for dynamic
languages still lack of precision and do not take into account some important
string features. Moreover, string obfuscation is very popular in the context of
dynamic language malicious code, for example, to hide code information inside
strings and then to dynamically transform strings into executable code. In this
scenario, more precise string analyses become a necessity. This paper proposes
a new semantics for string analysis placing a first step for handling dynamic
languages string features.
"
21309,Context encoders as a simple but powerful extension of word2vec,"  With a simple architecture and the ability to learn meaningful word
embeddings efficiently from texts containing billions of words, word2vec
remains one of the most popular neural language models used today. However, as
only a single embedding is learned for every word in the vocabulary, the model
fails to optimally represent words with multiple meanings. Additionally, it is
not possible to create embeddings for new (out-of-vocabulary) words on the
spot. Based on an intuitive interpretation of the continuous bag-of-words
(CBOW) word2vec model's negative sampling training objective in terms of
predicting context based similarities, we motivate an extension of the model we
call context encoders (ConEc). By multiplying the matrix of trained word2vec
embeddings with a word's average context vector, out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
embeddings and representations for a word with multiple meanings can be created
based on the word's local contexts. The benefits of this approach are
illustrated by using these word embeddings as features in the CoNLL 2003 named
entity recognition (NER) task.
"
21310,Sandwiches Missing Two Ingredients of Order Four,"  For a set ${\cal F}$ of graphs, an instance of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free
Sandwich Problem} is a pair $(G_1,G_2)$ consisting of two graphs $G_1$ and
$G_2$ with the same vertex set such that $G_1$ is a subgraph of $G_2$, and the
task is to determine an ${\cal F}$-free graph $G$ containing $G_1$ and
contained in $G_2$, or to decide that such a graph does not exist. Initially
motivated by the graph sandwich problem for trivially perfect graphs, which are
the $\{ P_4,C_4\}$-free graphs, we study the complexity of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc
free Sandwich Problem} for sets ${\cal F}$ containing two non-isomorphic graphs
of order four. We show that if ${\cal F}$ is one of the sets $\left\{ {\rm
diamond},K_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm diamond},C_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
diamond},{\rm paw}\right\}$, $\left\{ K_4,\overline{K_4}\right\}$, $\left\{
P_4,C_4\right\}$, $\left\{ P_4,\overline{\rm claw}\right\}$, $\left\{
P_4,\overline{\rm paw}\right\}$, $\left\{ P_4,\overline{\rm diamond}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm paw},C_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm paw},{\rm claw}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm paw},\overline{\rm claw}\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
paw},\overline{\rm paw}\right\}$, $\left\{ C_4,\overline{C_4}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm claw},\overline{\rm claw}\right\}$, and $\left\{ {\rm
claw},\overline{C_4}\right\}$, then the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free Sandwich Problem}
can be solved in polynomial time, and, if ${\cal F}$ is one of the sets
$\left\{ C_4,K_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm paw},K_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
paw},\overline{K_4}\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm paw},\overline{C_4}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm diamond},\overline{C_4}\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
paw},\overline{\rm diamond}\right\}$, and $\left\{ {\rm diamond},\overline{\rm
diamond}\right\}$, then the decision version of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free
Sandwich Problem} is NP-complete.
"
21311,Butterfly velocity and bulk causal structure,"  The butterfly velocity was recently proposed as a characteristic velocity of
chaos propagation in a local system. Compared to the Lieb-Robinson velocity
that bounds the propagation speed of all perturbations, the butterfly velocity,
studied in thermal ensembles, is an ""effective"" Lieb-Robinson velocity for a
subspace of the Hilbert space defined by the microcanonical ensemble. In this
paper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case
to a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider
the code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.
Using local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation
between the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk
causal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the
bulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given
Lieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light
cone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the
butterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the
local reconstructions of bulk local operators. If the bulk geometry satisfies
Einstein equation and the null energy condition, for rotation symmetric
geometries we prove that infrared operators always have a slower butterfly
velocity that the ultraviolet one. For asymptotic AdS geometries, this also
implies that the butterfly velocities of all operators are upper bounded by the
speed of light. We further prove that the butterfly velocity is equal to the
speed of light if the causal wedge of the boundary region coincides with its
entanglement wedge. Finally, we discuss the implication of our result to
geometries that are not asymptotically AdS, and in particular, obtain
constraints that must be satisfied by a dual theory of flat space gravity.
"
21312,Correlated atomic wires on substrates. II. Application to Hubbard wires,"  In the first part of our theoretical study of correlated atomic wires on
substrates, we introduced lattice models for a one-dimensional quantum wire on
a three-dimensional substrate and their approximation by quasi-one-dimensional
effective ladder models [arXiv:1704.07350]. In this second part, we apply this
approach to the case of a correlated wire with a Hubbard-type electron-electron
repulsion deposited on an insulating substrate. The ground-state and spectral
properties are investigated numerically using the density-matrix
renormalization group method and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. As a function
of the model parameters, we observe various phases with quasi-one-dimensional
low-energy excitations localized in the wire, namely paramagnetic Mott
insulators, Luttinger liquids, and spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chains. The validity
of the effective ladder models is assessed by studying the convergence with the
number of legs and comparing to the full three-dimensional model. We find that
narrow ladder models accurately reproduce the quasi-one-dimensional excitations
of the full three-dimensional model but predict only qualitatively whether
excitations are localized around the wire or delocalized in the
three-dimensional substrate.
"
21313,Distributed Bayesian Piecewise Sparse Linear Models,"  The importance of interpretability of machine learning models has been
increasing due to emerging enterprise predictive analytics, threat of data
privacy, accountability of artificial intelligence in society, and so on.
Piecewise linear models have been actively studied to achieve both accuracy and
interpretability. They often produce competitive accuracy against
state-of-the-art non-linear methods. In addition, their representations (i.e.,
rule-based segmentation plus sparse linear formula) are often preferred by
domain experts. A disadvantage of such models, however, is high computational
cost for simultaneous determinations of the number of ""pieces"" and cardinality
of each linear predictor, which has restricted their applicability to
middle-scale data sets. This paper proposes a distributed factorized asymptotic
Bayesian (FAB) inference of learning piece-wise sparse linear models on
distributed memory architectures. The distributed FAB inference solves the
simultaneous model selection issue without communicating $O(N)$ data where N is
the number of training samples and achieves linear scale-out against the number
of CPU cores. Experimental results demonstrate that the distributed FAB
inference achieves high prediction accuracy and performance scalability with
both synthetic and benchmark data.
"
21314,Mercury's magnetic field in the MESSENGER era,"  MESSENGER magnetometer data show that Mercury's magnetic field is not only
exceptionally weak but also has a unique geometry. The internal field resembles
an axial dipole that is offset to the North by 20% of the planetary radius.
This implies that the axial quadrupol is particularly strong while the dipole
tilt is likely below 0.8 degree. The close proximity to the sun in combination
with the weak internal field results in a very small and highly dynamic Hermean
magnetosphere. We review the current understanding of Mercury's internal and
external magnetic field and discuss possible explanations. Classical convection
driven core dynamos have a hard time to reproduce the observations. Strong
quadrupol contributions can be promoted by different measures, but they always
go along with a large dipole tilt and generally rather small scale fields. A
stably stratified outer core region seems required to explain not only the
particular geometry but also the weakness of the Hermean magnetic field. New
interior models suggest that Mercury's core likely hosts an iron snow zone
underneath the core-mantle boundary. The positive radial sulfur gradient likely
to develop in such a zone would indeed promote stable stratification. However,
even dynamo models that include the stable layer show Mercury-like magnetic
fields only for a fraction of the total simulation time. Large scale variations
in the core-mantle boundary heat flux promise to yield more persistent results
but are not compatible with the current understanding of Mercury's lower
mantle.
"
21315,A two-stage approach for estimating the parameters of an age-group epidemic model from incidence data,"  Age-dependent dynamics is an important characteristic of many infectious
diseases. Age-group epidemic models describe the infection dynamics in
different age-groups by allowing to set distinct parameter values for each.
However, such models are highly nonlinear and may have a large number of
unknown parameters. Thus, parameter estimation of age-group models, while
becoming a fundamental issue for both the scientific study and policy making in
infectious diseases, is not a trivial task in practice. In this paper, we
examine the estimation of the so called next-generation matrix using incidence
data of a single entire outbreak, and extend the approach to deal with
recurring outbreaks. Unlike previous studies, we do not assume any constraints
regarding the structure of the matrix. A novel two-stage approach is developed,
which allows for efficient parameter estimation from both statistical and
computational perspectives. Simulation studies corroborate the ability to
estimate accurately the parameters of the model for several realistic
scenarios. The model and estimation method are applied to real data of
influenza-like-illness in Israel. The parameter estimates of the key relevant
epidemiological parameters and the recovered structure of the estimated
next-generation matrix are in line with results obtained in previous studies.
"
21316,Sequential Double Robustness in Right-Censored Longitudinal Models,"  Consider estimating the G-formula for the counterfactual mean outcome under a
given treatment regime in a longitudinal study. Bang and Robins provided an
estimator for this quantity that relies on a sequential regression formulation
of this parameter. This approach is doubly robust in that it is consistent if
either the outcome regressions or the treatment mechanisms are consistently
estimated. We define a stronger notion of double robustness, termed sequential
double robustness, for estimators of the longitudinal G-formula. The definition
emerges naturally from a more general definition of sequential double
robustness for the outcome regression estimators. An outcome regression
estimator is sequentially doubly robust (SDR) if, at each subsequent time
point, either the outcome regression or the treatment mechanism is consistently
estimated. This form of robustness is exactly what one would anticipate is
attainable by studying the remainder term of a first-order expansion of the
G-formula parameter. We show that a particular implementation of an existing
procedure is SDR. We also introduce a novel SDR estimator, whose development
involves a novel translation of ideas used in targeted minimum loss-based
estimation to the infinite-dimensional setting.
"
21317,On the treewidth of triangulated 3-manifolds,"  In graph theory, as well as in 3-manifold topology, there exist several
width-type parameters to describe how ""simple"" or ""thin"" a given graph or
3-manifold is. These parameters, such as pathwidth or treewidth for graphs, or
the concept of thin position for 3-manifolds, play an important role when
studying algorithmic problems; in particular, there is a variety of problems in
computational 3-manifold topology - some of them known to be computationally
hard in general - that become solvable in polynomial time as soon as the dual
graph of the input triangulation has bounded treewidth.
In view of these algorithmic results, it is natural to ask whether every
3-manifold admits a triangulation of bounded treewidth. We show that this is
not the case, i.e., that there exists an infinite family of closed 3-manifolds
not admitting triangulations of bounded pathwidth or treewidth (the latter
implies the former, but we present two separate proofs).
We derive these results from work of Agol, of Scharlemann and Thompson, and
of Scharlemann, Schultens and Saito by exhibiting explicit connections between
the topology of a 3-manifold M on the one hand and width-type parameters of the
dual graphs of triangulations of M on the other hand, answering a question that
had been raised repeatedly by researchers in computational 3-manifold topology.
In particular, we show that if a closed, orientable, irreducible, non-Haken
3-manifold M has a triangulation of treewidth (resp. pathwidth) k then the
Heegaard genus of M is at most 24(k+1) (resp. 4(3k+1)).
"
21318,The Geometry of Large Tundra Lakes Observed in Historical Maps and Satellite Images,"  Tundra lakes are key components of the Arctic climate system because they
represent a source of methane to the atmosphere. In this paper, we aim to
analyze the geometry of the patterns formed by large ($>0.8$ km$^2$) tundra
lakes in the Russian High Arctic. We have studied images of tundra lakes in
historical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale
$0.21166$ km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google
Earth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale $0.1503$ km/pixel). The G.E.E. is a
cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis on over four
decades of Landsat data. We developed an image-processing algorithm to segment
these maps and images, measure the area and perimeter of each lake, and compute
the fractal dimension of the lakes in the images we have studied. Our results
indicate that as lake size increases, their fractal dimension bifurcates. For
lakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger
than $100$ km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.43$ to $1.87$). For lakes observed in
satellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $\sim$100
km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.31$ to $1.95$). Tundra lakes with a fractal
dimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their
area--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes
with a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed.
Preliminary analysis of changes in lake size over time in paired lakes (lakes
that were visually matched in both the historical map and the satellite
imagery) indicate that some lakes in our study region have increased in size
over time, whereas others have decreased in size over time. Lake size change
during this 39-year time interval can be up to half the size of the lake as
recorded in the historical map.
"
21319,Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for scattered shrub detection with Google Earth Imagery,"  There is a growing demand for accurate high-resolution land cover maps in
many fields, e.g., in land-use planning and biodiversity conservation.
Developing such maps has been performed using Object-Based Image Analysis
(OBIA) methods, which usually reach good accuracies, but require a high human
supervision and the best configuration for one image can hardly be extrapolated
to a different image. Recently, the deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have shown outstanding results in object recognition in the field of
computer vision. However, they have not been fully explored yet in land cover
mapping for detecting species of high biodiversity conservation interest. This
paper analyzes the potential of CNNs-based methods for plant species detection
using free high-resolution Google Earth T M images and provides an objective
comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study
the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs, which are protected as a priority
habitat under the European Union Habitats Directive. According to our results,
compared to OBIA-based methods, the proposed CNN-based detection model, in
combination with data-augmentation, transfer learning and pre-processing,
achieves higher performance with less human intervention and the knowledge it
acquires in the first image can be transferred to other images, which makes the
detection process very fast. The provided methodology can be systematically
reproduced for other species detection.
"
21320,Tight Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization,"  The nonnegative matrix factorization is a widely used, flexible matrix
decomposition, finding applications in biology, image and signal processing and
information retrieval, among other areas. Here we present a related matrix
factorization. A multi-objective optimization problem finds conical
combinations of templates that approximate a given data matrix. The templates
are chosen so that as far as possible only the initial data set can be
represented this way. However, the templates are not required to be nonnegative
nor convex combinations of the original data.
"
21321,Low Precision RNNs: Quantizing RNNs Without Losing Accuracy,"  Similar to convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
typically suffer from over-parameterization. Quantizing bit-widths of weights
and activations results in runtime efficiency on hardware, yet it often comes
at the cost of reduced accuracy. This paper proposes a quantization approach
that increases model size with bit-width reduction. This approach will allow
networks to perform at their baseline accuracy while still maintaining the
benefits of reduced precision and overall model size reduction.
"
21322,Unsupervised Representation Adversarial Learning Network: from Reconstruction to Generation,"  A good representation for arbitrarily complicated data should have the
capability of semantic generation, clustering and reconstruction. Previous
research has already achieved impressive performance on either one. This paper
aims at learning a disentangled representation effective for all of them in an
unsupervised way. To achieve all the three tasks together, we learn the forward
and inverse mapping between data and representation on the basis of a symmetric
adversarial process. In theory, we minimize the upper bound of the two
conditional entropy loss between the latent variables and the observations
together to achieve the cycle consistency. The newly proposed RepGAN is tested
on MNIST, fashionMNIST, CelebA, and SVHN datasets to perform unsupervised or
semi-supervised classification, generation and reconstruction tasks. The result
demonstrates that RepGAN is able to learn a useful and competitive
representation. To the author's knowledge, our work is the first one to achieve
both a high unsupervised classification accuracy and low reconstruction error
on MNIST.
"
21323,Quantitative Models of Imperfect Deception in Network Security using Signaling Games with Evidence,"  Deception plays a critical role in many interactions in communication and
network security. Game-theoretic models called ""cheap talk signaling games""
capture the dynamic and information asymmetric nature of deceptive
interactions. But signaling games inherently model undetectable deception. In
this paper, we investigate a model of signaling games in which the receiver can
detect deception with some probability. This model nests traditional signaling
games and complete information Stackelberg games as special cases. We present
the pure strategy perfect Bayesian Nash equilibria of the game. Then we
illustrate these analytical results with an application to active network
defense. The presence of evidence forces majority-truthful behavior and
eliminates some pure strategy equilibria. It always benefits the deceived
player, but surprisingly sometimes also benefits the deceiving player.
"
21324,Drawbacks and alternatives to the numerical calculation of the base inertial parameters expressions for low mobility mechanisms,"  Base inertial parameters constitute a minimal inertial parametrization of
mechanical systems that is of interest, for example, in parameter estimation
and model reduction. Numerical and symbolic methods are available to determine
their expressions. In this paper the problems associated with the numerical
determination of the base inertial parameters expressions in the context of low
mobility mechanisms are analyzed and discussed through and example. To
circumvent these problems two alternatives are proposed: a variable precision
arithmetic implementation of the customary numerical algorithm and the
application of a general symbolic method. Finally, the advantages of both
approaches compared to the numerical one are discussed in the context of the
proposed low mobility example.
"
21325,Self-Paced Multitask Learning with Shared Knowledge,"  This paper introduces self-paced task selection to multitask learning, where
instances from more closely related tasks are selected in a progression of
easier-to-harder tasks, to emulate an effective human education strategy, but
applied to multitask machine learning. We develop the mathematical foundation
for the approach based on iterative selection of the most appropriate task,
learning the task parameters, and updating the shared knowledge, optimizing a
new bi-convex loss function. This proposed method applies quite generally,
including to multitask feature learning, multitask learning with alternating
structure optimization, etc. Results show that in each of the above
formulations self-paced (easier-to-harder) task selection outperforms the
baseline version of these methods in all the experiments.
"
21326,Morphometric analysis of polygonal cracking patterns in desiccated starch slurries,"  We investigate the geometry of two-dimensional polygonal cracking that forms
on the air-exposed surface of dried starch slurries. Two different kinds of
starches, made from potato and corn, exhibited distinguished crack evolution,
and there were contrasting effects of slurry thickness on the probability
distribution of the polygonal cell area. The experimental findings are believed
to result from the difference in the shape and size of starch grains, which
strongly influence the capillary transport of water and tensile stress field
that drives the polygonal cracking.
"
21327,Parameterized Shifted Combinatorial Optimization,"  Shifted combinatorial optimization is a new nonlinear optimization framework
which is a broad extension of standard combinatorial optimization, involving
the choice of several feasible solutions at a time. This framework captures
well studied and diverse problems ranging from so-called vulnerability problems
to sharing and partitioning problems. In particular, every standard
combinatorial optimization problem has its shifted counterpart, which is
typically much harder. Already with explicitly given input set the shifted
problem may be NP-hard. In this article we initiate a study of the
parameterized complexity of this framework. First we show that shifting over an
explicitly given set with its cardinality as the parameter may be in XP, FPT or
P, depending on the objective function. Second, we study the shifted problem
over sets definable in MSO logic (which includes, e.g., the well known MSO
partitioning problems). Our main results here are that shifted combinatorial
optimization over MSO definable sets is in XP with respect to the MSO formula
and the treewidth (or more generally clique-width) of the input graph, and is
W[1]-hard even under further severe restrictions.
"
21328,Mermin-Wagner at the Crossover Temperature,"  Mermin-Wagner excludes spontaneous (staggered) magnetization in isotropic
ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) Heisenberg models at finite temperature in
spatial dimensions $d \le 2$. While the proof relies on the Bogoliubov
inequality, here we illuminate the theorem from an effective field theory point
of view. We estimate the crossover temperature $T_c$ and show that, in weak
external fields $H$, it tends to zero: $T_c \propto \sqrt{H}$ ($d=1$) and $T_c
\propto 1/|\ln H|$ ($d=2$). Including the case $d$=3, we derive upper bounds
for the (staggered) magnetization by combining microscopic and effective
perspectives -- unfortunately, these bounds are not restrictive.

21329,The injectivity radius of Lie manifolds,"  We prove in a direct, geometric way that for any compatible Riemannian metric
on a Lie manifold the injectivity radius is positive
"
21330,Inverse Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning,"  We address the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in Markov decision
processes where the agent is risk-sensitive. In particular, we model
risk-sensitivity in a reinforcement learning framework by making use of models
of human decision-making having their origins in behavioral psychology,
behavioral economics, and neuroscience. We propose a gradient-based inverse
reinforcement learning algorithm that minimizes a loss function defined on the
observed behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique on
two examples, the first of which is the canonical Grid World example and the
second of which is a Markov decision process modeling passengers' decisions
regarding ride-sharing. In the latter, we use pricing and travel time data from
a ride-sharing company to construct the transition probabilities and rewards of
the Markov decision process.
"
21331,Correlations and confinement of excitations in an asymmetric Hubbard ladder,"  Correlation functions and low-energy excitations are investigated in the
asymmetric two-leg ladder consisting of a Hubbard chain and a noninteracting
tight-binding (Fermi) chain using the density matrix renormalization group
method. The behavior of charge, spin and pairing correlations is discussed for
the four phases found at half filling, namely, Luttinger liquid, Kondo-Mott
insulator, spin-gapped Mott insulator and correlated band insulator.
Quasi-long-range antiferromagnetic spin correlations are found in the Hubbard
leg in the Luttinger liquid phase only. Pair-density-wave correlations are
studied to understand the structure of bound pairs found in the Fermi leg of
the spin-gapped Mott phase at half filling and at light doping but we find no
enhanced pairing correlations. Low-energy excitations cause variations of spin
and charge densities on both legs that demonstrate the confinement of the
lowest charge excitations on the Fermi leg while the lowest spin excitations
are localized on the Hubbard leg in the three insulating phases. The velocities
of charge, spin, and single-particle excitations are investigated to clarify
the confinement of elementary excitations in the Luttinger liquid phase. The
observed spatial separation of elementary spin and charge excitations could
facilitate the coexistence of different (quasi-)long-range orders in

21332,Notes about collision monochromatization in $e^+e^-$ colliders,"  The manuscript describes several monochromatization schemes starting from
A.~Renieri \cite{ref:Renieri} proposal for head-on collisions based on
correlation between particles transverse position and energy deviation. We
briefly explain initial proposal and expand it for crossing angle collisions.
Then we discuss new monochromatization scheme for crossing angle collisions
based on correlation between particles longitudinal position and energy
deviation.
"
21333,Combinatorial Cost Sharing,"  We introduce a combinatorial variant of the cost sharing problem: several
services can be provided to each player and each player values every
combination of services differently. A publicly known cost function specifies
the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial
cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player
gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are
(economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging
(i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting,
combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing
dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task.
We present the Potential Mechanism -- a combination of the VCG mechanism and
a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's
potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism
that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the
same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution
shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is
approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations,
symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with
general valuations.
"
21334,A new family of one-coincidence sets of sequences with dispersed elements for frequency hopping CDMA systems,"  We present a new family of one-coincidence sequence sets suitable for
frequency hopping code division multiple access (FH-CDMA) systems with
dispersed (low density) sequence elements. These sets are derived from
one-coincidence prime sequence sets, such that for each one-coincidence prime
sequence set there is a new one-coincidence set comprised of sequences with
dispersed sequence elements, required in some circumstances, for FH-CDMA
systems. Getting rid of crowdedness of sequence elements is achieved by
doubling the size of the sequence element alphabet. In addition, this doubling
process eases control over the distance between adjacent sequence elements.
Properties of the new sets are discussed.
"
21335,Crowdsourcing with Tullock contests: A new perspective,"  Incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing have been extensively studied under
the framework of all-pay auctions. Along a distinct line, this paper proposes
to use Tullock contests as an alternative tool to design incentive mechanisms
for crowdsourcing. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to
attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.
In this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by
superseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock
contests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's
contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that
this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited
for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b)
it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to
an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional,
fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to
compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our
mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds
on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players'
social welfare.
"
21336,Can Decentralized Algorithms Outperform Centralized Algorithms? A Case Study for Decentralized Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent,"  Most distributed machine learning systems nowadays, including TensorFlow and
CNTK, are built in a centralized fashion. One bottleneck of centralized
algorithms lies on high communication cost on the central node. Motivated by
this, we ask, can decentralized algorithms be faster than its centralized
counterpart?
Although decentralized PSGD (D-PSGD) algorithms have been studied by the
control community, existing analysis and theory do not show any advantage over
centralized PSGD (C-PSGD) algorithms, simply assuming the application scenario
where only the decentralized network is available. In this paper, we study a
D-PSGD algorithm and provide the first theoretical analysis that indicates a
regime in which decentralized algorithms might outperform centralized
algorithms for distributed stochastic gradient descent. This is because D-PSGD
has comparable total computational complexities to C-PSGD but requires much
less communication cost on the busiest node. We further conduct an empirical
study to validate our theoretical analysis across multiple frameworks (CNTK and
Torch), different network configurations, and computation platforms up to 112
GPUs. On network configurations with low bandwidth or high latency, D-PSGD can
be up to one order of magnitude faster than its well-optimized centralized
counterparts.
"
21337,Learning User Intent from Action Sequences on Interactive Systems,"  Interactive systems have taken over the web and mobile space with increasing
participation from users. Applications across every marketing domain can now be
accessed through mobile or web where users can directly perform certain actions
and reach a desired outcome. Actions of user on a system, though, can be
representative of a certain intent. Ability to learn this intent through user's
actions can help draw certain insight into the behavior of users on a system.
In this paper, we present models to optimize interactive systems by learning
and analyzing user intent through their actions on the system. We present a
four phased model that uses time-series of interaction actions sequentially
using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based sequence learning system that helps
build a model for intent recognition. Our system then provides an objective
specific maximization followed by analysis and contrasting methods in order to
identify spaces of improvement in the interaction system. We discuss deployment
scenarios for such a system and present results from evaluation on an online
marketplace using user clickstream data.
"
21338,Laman Graphs are Generically Bearing Rigid in Arbitrary Dimensions,"  This paper addresses the problem of constructing bearing rigid networks in
arbitrary dimensions. We first show that the bearing rigidity of a network is a
generic property that is critically determined by the underlying graph of the
network. A new notion termed generic bearing rigidity is defined for graphs. If
the underlying graph of a network is generically bearing rigid, then the
network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations; otherwise, the network
is not bearing rigid for any configuration. As a result, the key to construct
bearing rigid networks is to construct generically bearing rigid graphs. The
main contribution of this paper is to prove that Laman graphs, which can be
generated by the Henneberg construction, are generically bearing rigid in
arbitrary dimensions. As a consequence, if the underlying graph of a network is
Laman, the network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations in arbitrary
dimensions.
"
21339,"Finding Dominating Induced Matchings in $(S_{2,2,3})$-Free Graphs in Polynomial Time","  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite undirected graph. An edge set $E' \subseteq E$ is a
{\em dominating induced matching} ({\em d.i.m.}) in $G$ if every edge in $E$ is
intersected by exactly one edge of $E'$. The \emph{Dominating Induced Matching}
(\emph{DIM}) problem asks for the existence of a d.i.m.\ in $G$; this problem
is also known as the \emph{Efficient Edge Domination} problem; it is the
Efficient Domination problem for line graphs.
The DIM problem is motivated by parallel resource allocation problems,
encoding theory and network routing. It is \NP-complete even for very
restricted graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3
and is solvable in linear time for $P_7$-free graphs, and in polynomial time
for $S_{1,2,4}$-free graphs as well as for $S_{2,2,2}$-free graphs. In this
paper, combining two distinct approaches, we solve it in polynomial time for
$S_{2,2,3}$-free graphs.
"
21340,Symmetry reduction and soliton-like solutions for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation,"  We analyze the gKdV equation, a generalized version of Korteweg-de Vries with
an arbitrary function $f(u)$. In general, for a function $f(u)$ the Lie algebra
of symmetries of gKdV is the $2$-dimensional Lie algebra of translations of the
plane $xt$. This implies the existence of plane wave solutions. Indeed, for
some specific values of $f(u)$ the equation gKdV admits a Lie algebra of
symmetries of dimension grater than $2$. We compute the similarity reductions
corresponding to these exceptional symmetries. We prove that the gKdV equation
has soliton-like solutions under some general assumptions, and we find a closed
formula for the plane wave solutions, that are of hyperbolic secant type.
"
21341,Existence theory for magma equations in dimension two and higher,"  We examine a degenerate, dispersive, nonlinear wave equation related to the
evolution of partially molten rock in dimensions two and higher. This
simplified model, for a scalar field capturing the melt fraction by volume, has
been studied by direct numerical simulation where it has been observed to
develop stable solitary waves. In this work, we prove local in time
well-posedness results for the time dependent equation, on both the whole space
and the torus, for dimensions two and higher. We also prove the existence of
the solitary wave solutions in dimensions two and higher.
"
21342,A short guide through integration theorems of generalized distributions,"  The generalization of Frobenius' theorem to foliations with singularities is
usually attributed to Stefan and Sussmann, for their simultaneous discovery
around 1973. However, their result is often referred to without caring much on
the precise statement, as some sort of magic spell. This may be explained by
the fact that the literature is not consensual on a unique formulation of the
theorem, and because the history of the research leading to this result has
been flawed by many claims that turned to be refuted some years later. This,
together with the difficulty of doing proof-reading on this topic, brought much
confusion about the precise statement of Stefan-Sussmann's theorem. This paper
is dedicated to bring some light on this subject, by investigating the
different statements and arguments that were put forward in geometric control
theory between 1962 and 1994 regarding the problem of integrability of
generalized distributions. We will present the genealogy of the main ideas and
show that many mathematicians that were involved in this field made some
mistakes that were successfully refuted. Moreover, we want to address the
prominent influence of Hermann on this topic, as well as the fact that some
statements of Stefan and Sussmann turned to be wrong. In this paper, we intend
to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the problem of
integrability of generalized distributions, and to reduce the confusion
surrounding these difficult questions.
"
21343,Polarization induced interference within electromagnetically induced transparency for atoms of double-V linkage,"  People have been paying attention to the role of atoms' complex internal
level structures in the research of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) for a long time, where the various degenerate Zeeman levels usually
generate complex linkage patterns for the atomic transitions. It turns out,
with special choices of the atomic states and the atomic transitions' linkage
structure, clear signatures of quantum interference induced by the probe and
coupling light's polarizations can emerge from a typical EIT phenomena. We
propose to study a four state system with double-V linkage pattern for the
transitions and analyze the polarization induced interference under the EIT
condition. We show that such interference arises naturally under mild
conditions on the optical field and atom manipulation. Its anticipated
properties and its potential application of all optical switching in
polarization degree of freedom are also discussed. Moreover, we construct a
variation form of double-M linkage pattern where the polarization induced
interference enables polarization-dependent cross-modulation between incident
lights that can be effective even at the few-photon level. The theme is to gain
more insight into the essential question: how can we build non-trivial optical
medium where incident lights will induce polarization-dependent non-linear
optical interactions, covering a wide range of the incidence intensity from the
many-photon level to the few-photon level, respectively.
"
21344,A note on X-rays of permutations and a problem of Brualdi and Fritscher,"  The subject of this note is a challenging conjecture about X-rays of
permutations which is a special case of a conjecture regarding Skolem
sequences. In relation to this, Brualdi and Fritscher [Linear Algebra and its
Applications, 2014] posed the following problem: Determine a bijection between
extremal Skolem sets and binary Hankel X-rays of permutation matrices. We give
such a bijection, along with some related observations.
"
21345,Differential Evolution and Bayesian Optimisation for Hyper-Parameter Selection in Mixed-Signal Neuromorphic Circuits Applied to UAV Obstacle Avoidance,"  The Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) is a an identified neuron of the
locust that detects looming objects and triggers its escape responses.
Understanding the neural principles and networks that lead to these fast and
robust responses can lead to the design of efficient facilitate obstacle
avoidance strategies in robotic applications. Here we present a neuromorphic
spiking neural network model of the LGMD driven by the output of a neuromorphic
Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), which has been optimised to produce robust and
reliable responses in the face of the constraints and variability of its mixed
signal analogue-digital circuits. As this LGMD model has many parameters, we
use the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to optimise its parameter space.
We also investigate the use of Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (SADE)
which has been shown to ameliorate the difficulties of finding appropriate
input parameters for DE. We explore the use of two biological mechanisms:
synaptic plasticity and membrane adaptivity in the LGMD. We apply DE and SADE
to find parameters best suited for an obstacle avoidance system on an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV), and show how it outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian
optimisation used for comparison.
"
21346,Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking,"  Methods that learn representations of nodes in a graph play a critical role
in network analysis since they enable many downstream learning tasks. We
propose Graph2Gauss - an approach that can efficiently learn versatile node
embeddings on large scale (attributed) graphs that show strong performance on
tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most approaches
that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, we
embed each node as a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to capture uncertainty
about the representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised method that
handles inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to different types of
graphs: plain/attributed, directed/undirected. By leveraging both the network
structure and the associated node attributes, we are able to generalize to
unseen nodes without additional training. To learn the embeddings we adopt a
personalized ranking formulation w.r.t. the node distances that exploits the
natural ordering of the nodes imposed by the network structure. Experiments on
real world networks demonstrate the high performance of our approach,
outperforming state-of-the-art network embedding methods on several different
tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling uncertainty - by
analyzing it we can estimate neighborhood diversity and detect the intrinsic
latent dimensionality of a graph.
"
21347,Explaining Anomalies in Groups with Characterizing Subspace Rules,"  Anomaly detection has numerous applications and has been studied vastly. We
consider a complementary problem that has a much sparser literature: anomaly
description. Interpretation of anomalies is crucial for practitioners for
sense-making, troubleshooting, and planning actions. To this end, we present a
new approach called x-PACS (for eXplaining Patterns of Anomalies with
Characterizing Subspaces), which ""reverse-engineers"" the known anomalies by
identifying (1) the groups (or patterns) that they form, and (2) the
characterizing subspace and feature rules that separate each anomalous pattern
from normal instances. Explaining anomalies in groups not only saves analyst
time and gives insight into various types of anomalies, but also draws
attention to potentially critical, repeating anomalies.
In developing x-PACS, we first construct a desiderata for the anomaly
description problem. From a descriptive data mining perspective, our method
exhibits five desired properties in our desiderata. Namely, it can unearth
anomalous patterns (i) of multiple different types, (ii) hidden in arbitrary
subspaces of a high dimensional space, (iii) interpretable by the analysts,
(iv) different from normal patterns of the data, and finally (v) succinct,
providing the shortest data description. Furthermore, x-PACS is highly
parallelizable and scales linearly in terms of data size.
No existing work on anomaly description satisfies all of these properties
simultaneously. While not our primary goal, the anomalous patterns we find
serve as interpretable ""signatures"" and can be used for detection. We show the
effectiveness of x-PACS in explanation as well as detection on real-world
datasets as compared to state-of-the-art.
"
21348,VAMPnets: Deep learning of molecular kinetics,"  There is an increasing demand for computing the relevant structures,
equilibria and long-timescale kinetics of biomolecular processes, such as
protein-drug binding, from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations.
Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural
features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension-reduced data, and
estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion
rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a
substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will
lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for
Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular
kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire
mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole
data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs
equally or better than state-of-the art Markov modeling methods and provides
easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.
"
21349,Toward deciphering developmental patterning with deep neural network,"  Dynamics of complex biological systems is driven by intricate networks, the
current knowledge of which are often incomplete. The traditional systems
biology modeling usually implements an ad hoc fixed set of differential
equations with predefined function forms. Such an approach often suffers from
overfitting or underfitting and thus inadequate predictive power, especially
when dealing with systems of high complexity. This problem could be overcome by
deep neuron network (DNN). Choosing pattern formation of the gap genes in
Drosophila early embryogenesis as an example, we established a differential
equation model whose synthesis term is expressed as a DNN. The model yields
perfect fitting and impressively accurate predictions on mutant patterns. We
further mapped the trained DNN into a simplified conventional regulation
network, which is consistent with the existing body of knowledge. The DNN model
could lay a foundation of ""in-silico-embryo"", which can regenerate a great
variety of interesting phenomena, and on which one can perform all kinds of
perturbations to discover underlying mechanisms. This approach can be readily
applied to a variety of complex biological systems.
"
21350,Whispered-to-voiced Alaryngeal Speech Conversion with Generative Adversarial Networks,"  Most methods of voice restoration for patients suffering from aphonia either
produce whispered or monotone speech. Apart from intelligibility, this type of
speech lacks expressiveness and naturalness due to the absence of pitch
(whispered speech) or artificial generation of it (monotone speech). Existing
techniques to restore prosodic information typically combine a vocoder, which
parameterises the speech signal, with machine learning techniques that predict
prosodic information. In contrast, this paper describes an end-to-end neural
approach for estimating a fully-voiced speech waveform from whispered
alaryngeal speech. By adapting our previous work in speech enhancement with
generative adversarial networks, we develop a speaker-dependent model to
perform whispered-to-voiced speech conversion. Preliminary qualitative results
show effectiveness in re-generating voiced speech, with the creation of
realistic pitch contours.
"
21351,A graph-theoretic description of scale-multiplicative semigroups of automorphisms,"  It is shown that a flat subgroup, $H$, of the totally disconnected, locally
compact group $G$ decomposes into a finite number of subsemigroups on which the
scale function is multiplicative. The image, $P$, of a multiplicative semigroup
in the quotient, $H/H(1)$, of $H$ by its uniscalar subgroup has a unique
minimal generating set which determines a natural Cayley graph structure on
$P$. For each compact, open subgroup $U$ of $G$, a graph is defined and it is
shown that if $P$ is multiplicative over $U$ then this graph is a regular,
rooted, strongly simple $P$-graph. This extends to higher rank the result of R.
Möller that $U$ is tidy for $x$ if and only if a certain graph is a regular,
rooted tree.
"
21352,Half-Heusler alloy LiBaBi: A new topological semimetal with five-fold band degeneracy,"  Based on first-principles study, we report the finding of a new topological
semimetal LiBaBi in half-Heusler phase. The remarkable feature of this
nonmagnetic, inversion-symmetry-breaking material is that it consists of only
simple $s$- and $p$-block elements. Interestingly, the material is ordinary
insulator in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and becomes nodal-surface
topological semimetal showing drumhead states when SOC is included. This is in
stark contrast to other nodal-line and nodal-surface semimetals, where the
extended nodal structure is destroyed once SOC is included. Importantly, the
linear band crossings host three-, four-, five- and six-fold degeneracies near
the Fermi level, making this compound very attractive for the study of
`unconventional' fermions. The band crossing points form a three-dimensional
nodal structure around the zone center at the Fermi level. We identify the
surface states responsible for the appearance of the drumhead states. The alloy
also shows a phase transition from topological semimetal to a trivial insulator
on application of pressure. In addition to revealing an intriguing effect of
SOC on the nodal structure, our findings introduce a new half-Heusler alloy in
the family of topological semimetals, thus creating more avenues for
experimental exploration.
"
21353,A task-driven implementation of a simple numerical solver for hyperbolic conservation laws,"  This article describes the implementation of an all-in-one numerical
procedure within the runtime StarPU. In order to limit the complexity of the
method, for the sake of clarity of the presentation of the non-classical
task-driven programming environnement, we have limited the numerics to first
order in space and time. Results show that the task distribution is efficient
if the tasks are numerous and individually large enough so that the task heap
can be saturated by tasks which computational time covers the task management
overhead. Next, we also see that even though they are mostly faster on graphic
cards, not all the tasks are suitable for GPUs, which brings forward the
importance of the task scheduler. Finally, we look at a more realistic system
of conservation laws with an expensive source term, what allows us to conclude
and open on future works involving higher local arithmetic intensity, by
increasing the order of the numerical method or by enriching the model
(increased number of parameters and therefore equations).
"
21354,Composition of PPT Maps,"  M. Christandl conjectured that the composition of any trace preserving PPT
map with itself is entanglement breaking. We prove that Christandl's conjecture
holds asymptotically by showing that the distance between the iterates of any
unital or trace preserving PPT map and the set of entanglement breaking maps
tends to zero. Finally, for every graph we define a one-parameter family of
maps on matrices and determine the least value of the parameter such that the
map is variously, positive, completely positive, PPT and entanglement breaking
in terms of properties of the graph. Our estimates are sharp enough to conclude
that Christandl's conjecture holds for these families.
"
21355,Multi-View Image Generation from a Single-View,"  This paper addresses a challenging problem -- how to generate multi-view
cloth images from only a single view input. To generate realistic-looking
images with different views from the input, we propose a new image generation
model termed VariGANs that combines the strengths of the variational inference
and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed VariGANs model
generates the target image in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of a single pass
which suffers from severe artifacts. It first performs variational inference to
model global appearance of the object (e.g., shape and color) and produce a
coarse image with a different view. Conditioned on the generated low resolution
images, it then proceeds to perform adversarial learning to fill details and
generate images of consistent details with the input. Extensive experiments
conducted on two clothing datasets, MVC and DeepFashion, have demonstrated that
images of a novel view generated by our model are more plausible than those
generated by existing approaches, in terms of more consistent global appearance
as well as richer and sharper details.
"
21356,Equidistribution of Neumann data mass on simplices and a simple inverse problem,"  In this paper we study the behaviour of the Neumann data of Dirichlet
eigenfunctions on simplices. We prove that the $L^2$ norm of the
(semi-classical) Neumann data on each face is equal to $2/n$ times the
$(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the face divided by the volume of the simplex.
This is a generalization of \cite{Chr-tri} to higher dimensions. Again it is
{\it not} an asymptotic, but an exact formula. The proof is by simple
integrations by parts and linear algebra.
We also consider the following inverse problem: do the {\it norms} of the
Neumann data on a simplex determine a constant coefficient elliptic operator?
The answer is yes in dimension 2 and no in higher dimensions.
"
21357,A machine learning approach for efficient uncertainty quantification using multiscale methods,"  Several multiscale methods account for sub-grid scale features using coarse
scale basis functions. For example, in the Multiscale Finite Volume method the
coarse scale basis functions are obtained by solving a set of local problems
over dual-grid cells. We introduce a data-driven approach for the estimation of
these coarse scale basis functions. Specifically, we employ a neural network
predictor fitted using a set of solution samples from which it learns to
generate subsequent basis functions at a lower computational cost than solving
the local problems. The computational advantage of this approach is realized
for uncertainty quantification tasks where a large number of realizations has
to be evaluated. We attribute the ability to learn these basis functions to the
modularity of the local problems and the redundancy of the permeability patches
between samples. The proposed method is evaluated on elliptic problems yielding
very promising results.
"
21358,Quadratic Upper Bound for Recursive Teaching Dimension of Finite VC Classes,"  In this work we study the quantitative relation between the recursive
teaching dimension (RTD) and the VC dimension (VCD) of concept classes of
finite sizes. The RTD of a concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n$,
introduced by Zilles et al. (2011), is a combinatorial complexity measure
characterized by the worst-case number of examples necessary to identify a
concept in $\mathcal C$ according to the recursive teaching model.
For any finite concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ with
$\mathrm{VCD}(\mathcal C)=d$, Simon & Zilles (2015) posed an open problem
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d)$, i.e., is RTD linearly upper bounded by VCD?
Previously, the best known result is an exponential upper bound
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d \cdot 2^d)$, due to Chen et al. (2016). In this
paper, we show a quadratic upper bound: $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d^2)$,
much closer to an answer to the open problem. We also discuss the challenges in
fully solving the problem.
"
21359,Joining Jolie to Docker - Orchestration of Microservices on a Containers-as-a-Service Layer,"  Cloud computing is steadily growing and, as IaaS vendors have started to
offer pay-as-you-go billing policies, it is fundamental to achieve as much
elasticity as possible, avoiding over-provisioning that would imply higher
costs. In this paper, we briefly analyse the orchestration characteristics of
PaaSSOA, a proposed architecture already implemented for Jolie microservices,
and Kubernetes, one of the various orchestration plugins for Docker; then, we
outline similarities and differences of the two approaches, with respect to
their own domain of application. Furthermore, we investigate some ideas to
achieve a federation of the two technologies, proposing an architectural
composition of Jolie microservices on Docker Container-as-a-Service layer.
"
21360,On Calculation of Bounds for Greedy Algorithms when Applied to Sensor Selection Problems,"  We consider the problem of studying the performance of greedy algorithm on
sensor selection problem for stable linear systems with Kalman Filter.
Specifically, the objective is to find the system parameters that affects the
performance of greedy algorithms and conditions where greedy algorithm always
produces optimal solutions. In this paper, we developed an upper bound for
performance ratio of greedy algorithm, which is based on the work of Dr.Zhang
\cite{Sundaram} and offers valuable insight into the system parameters that
affects the performance of greedy algorithm. We also proposes a set of
conditions where greedy algorithm will always produce the optimal solution. We
then show in simulations how the system parameters mentioned by the performance
ratio bound derived in this work affects the performance of greedy algorithm.
"
21361,Generators of reductions of ideals in a local Noetherian ring with finite residue field,"  Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a local Noetherian ring with residue field $k$.
While much is known about the generating sets of reductions of ideals of $R$ if
$k$ is infinite, the case in which $k$ is finite is less well understood. We
investigate the existence (or lack thereof) of proper reductions of an ideal of
$R$ and the number of generators needed for a reduction in the case $k$ is a
finite field. When $R$ is one-dimensional, we give a formula for the smallest
integer $n$ for which every ideal has an $n$-generated reduction. It follows
that in a one-dimensional local Noetherian ring every ideal has a principal
reduction if and only if the number of maximal ideals in the normalization of
the reduced quotient of $R$ is at most $|k|$. In higher dimensions, we show
that for any positive integer, there exists an ideal of $R$ that does not have
an $n$-generated reduction and that if $n \geq \dim R$ this ideal can be chosen
to be $\mathfrak{m}$-primary. In the case where $R$ is a two-dimensional
regular local ring, we construct an example of an integrally closed
$\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal that does not have a $2$-generated reduction and
thus answer in the negative a question raised by Heinzer and Shannon.
"
21362,Particle-like Structure of Lie algebras,"  If a Lie algebra structure g on a vector space is the sum of a family of
mutually compatible Lie algebra structures g_i's, we say that g is simply
assembled from the g_i's. Repeating this procedure with a number of Lie
algebras, themselves simply assembled from the g_i's, one obtains a Lie algebra
assembled in two steps from the g_i's, and so on. We describe the process of
modular disassembling of a Lie algebra into a unimodular and a non-unimodular
part. We then study two inverse questions: which Lie algebras can be assembled
from a given family of Lie algebras, and from which Lie algebras can a given
Lie algebra be assembled? We develop some basic assembling and disassembling
techniques that constitute the elements of a new approach to the general theory
of Lie algebras. The main result of our theory is that any finite-dimensional
Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or over R
can be assembled in a finite number of steps from two elementary constituents,
which we call dyons and triadons. Up to an abelian summand, a dyon is a Lie
algebra structure isomorphic to the non-abelian 2-dimensional Lie algebra,
while a triadon is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. As
an example, we describe constructions of classical Lie algebras from triadons.
"
21363,"Reversed Dickson polynomials of the $(k+1)$-th kind over finite fields, II","  Let $p$ be an odd prime. In this paper, we study the permutation behaviour of
the reversed Dickson polynomials of the $(k+1)$-th kind $D_{n,k}(1,x)$ when
$n=p^{l_1}+3$, $n=p^{l_1}+p^{l_2}+p^{l_3}$, and
$n=p^{l_1}+p^{l_2}+p^{l_3}+p^{l_4}$, where $l_1, l_2$, $l_3$, and $l_4$ are
non-negative integers. A generalization to $n=p^{l_1}+p^{l_2}+\cdots +p^{l_i}$
is also shown. We find some conditions under which $D_{n,k}(1,x)$ is not a
permutation polynomial over finite fields for certain values of $n$ and $k$. We
also present a generalization of a recent result regarding $D_{p^l-1,1}(1,x)$
and present some algebraic and arithmetic properties of $D_{n,k}(1,x)$.

21364,Improving Session Recommendation with Recurrent Neural Networks by Exploiting Dwell Time,"  Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been applied to the task of
session-based recommendation. These approaches use RNNs to predict the next
item in a user session based on the previ- ously visited items. While some
approaches consider additional item properties, we argue that item dwell time
can be used as an implicit measure of user interest to improve session-based
item recommen- dations. We propose an extension to existing RNN approaches that
captures user dwell time in addition to the visited items and show that
recommendation performance can be improved. Additionally, we investigate the
usefulness of a single validation split for model selection in the case of
minor improvements and find that in our case the best model is not selected and
a fold-like study with different validation sets is necessary to ensure the
selection of the best model.
"
21365,Universal Spatiotemporal Sampling Sets for Discrete Spatially Invariant Evolution Systems,"  Let $(I,+)$ be a finite abelian group and $\mathbf{A}$ be a circular
convolution operator on $\ell^2(I)$. The problem under consideration is how to
construct minimal $\Omega \subset I$ and $l_i$ such that $Y=\{\mathbf{e}_i,
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}_i, \cdots, \mathbf{A}^{l_i}\mathbf{e}_i: i\in \Omega\}$ is
a frame for $\ell^2(I)$, where $\{\mathbf{e}_i: i\in I\}$ is the canonical
basis of $\ell^2(I)$. This problem is motivated by the spatiotemporal sampling
problem in discrete spatially invariant evolution systems. We will show that
the cardinality of $\Omega $ should be at least equal to the largest geometric
multiplicity of eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, and we consider the universal
spatiotemporal sampling sets $(\Omega, l_i)$ for convolution operators
$\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues subject to the same largest geometric
multiplicity. We will give an algebraic characterization for such sampling sets
and show how this problem is linked with sparse signal processing theory and
polynomial interpolation theory.

21366,Self-Organizing Maps Classification with Application to Laptop's Adapters Magnetic Field,"  This paper presents an application of the Self-Organizing-Map classification
method, which is used for classification of the extremely low frequency
magnetic field emission in the near neighborhood of the laptop adapters. The
experiment is performed on different laptop adapters of the same
characteristics. After that, the Self-Organizing-Map classification on the
obtained emission data is performed. The classification results establish the
typical emission levels of the laptop adapters, which are far above the safety
standards' limit. At the end, a discussion is carried out about the importance
of using the classification as a possible solution for safely use the laptop
adapters in order to reduce the negative effects of the magnetic field emission
to the laptop users.
"
21367,Attention Models in Graphs: A Survey,"  Graph-structured data arise naturally in many different application domains.
By representing data as graphs, we can capture entities (i.e., nodes) as well
as their relationships (i.e., edges) with each other. Many useful insights can
be derived from graph-structured data as demonstrated by an ever-growing body
of work focused on graph mining. However, in the real-world, graphs can be both
large - with many complex patterns - and noisy which can pose a problem for
effective graph mining. An effective way to deal with this issue is to
incorporate ""attention"" into graph mining solutions. An attention mechanism
allows a method to focus on task-relevant parts of the graph, helping it to
make better decisions. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and focused
survey of the literature on the emerging field of graph attention models. We
introduce three intuitive taxonomies to group existing work. These are based on
problem setting (type of input and output), the type of attention mechanism
used, and the task (e.g., graph classification, link prediction, etc.). We
motivate our taxonomies through detailed examples and use each to survey
competing approaches from a unique standpoint. Finally, we highlight several
challenges in the area and discuss promising directions for future work.
"
21368,Multiplexing 200 modes on a single digital hologram,"  The on-demand tailoring of light's spatial shape is of great relevance in a
wide variety of research areas. Computer-controlled devices, such as Spatial
Light Modulators (SLMs) or Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), offer a very
accurate, flexible and fast holographic means to this end. Remarkably, digital
holography affords the simultaneous generation of multiple beams
(multiplexing), a tool with numerous applications in many fields. Here, we
provide a self-contained tutorial on light beam multiplexing. Through the use
of several examples, the readers will be guided step by step in the process of
light beam shaping and multiplexing. Additionally, on the multiplexing
capabilities of SLMs to provide a quantitative analysis on the maximum number
of beams that can be multiplexed on a single SLM, showing approximately 200
modes on a single hologram.
"
21369,Ranking influential spreaders is an ill-defined problem,"  Finding influential spreaders of information and disease in networks is an
important theoretical problem, and one of considerable recent interest. It has
been almost exclusively formulated as a node-ranking problem -- methods for
identifying influential spreaders rank nodes according to how influential they
are. In this work, we show that the ranking approach does not necessarily work:
the set of most influential nodes depends on the number of nodes in the set.
Therefore, the set of $n$ most important nodes to vaccinate does not need to
have any node in common with the set of $n+1$ most important nodes. We propose
a method for quantifying the extent and impact of this phenomenon, and show
that it is common in both empirical and model networks.
"
21370,Fixing a Broken ELBO,"  Recent work in unsupervised representation learning has focused on learning
deep directed latent-variable models. Fitting these models by maximizing the
marginal likelihood or evidence is typically intractable, thus a common
approximation is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. However,
maximum likelihood training (whether exact or approximate) does not necessarily
result in a good latent representation, as we demonstrate both theoretically
and empirically. In particular, we derive variational lower and upper bounds on
the mutual information between the input and the latent variable, and use these
bounds to derive a rate-distortion curve that characterizes the tradeoff
between compression and reconstruction accuracy. Using this framework, we
demonstrate that there is a family of models with identical ELBO, but different
quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Our framework also suggests a
simple new method to ensure that latent variable models with powerful
stochastic decoders do not ignore their latent code.
"
21371,Wavelet Shrinkage and Thresholding based Robust Classification for Brain Computer Interface,"  A macaque monkey is trained to perform two different kinds of tasks, memory
aided and visually aided. In each task, the monkey saccades to eight possible
target locations. A classifier is proposed for direction decoding and task
decoding based on local field potentials (LFP) collected from the prefrontal
cortex. The LFP time-series data is modeled in a nonparametric regression
framework, as a function corrupted by Gaussian noise. It is shown that if the
function belongs to Besov bodies, then using the proposed wavelet shrinkage and
thresholding based classifier is robust and consistent. The classifier is then
applied to the LFP data to achieve high decoding performance. The proposed
classifier is also quite general and can be applied for the classification of
other types of time-series data as well, not necessarily brain data.
"
21372,SCALAR - Simultaneous Calibration of 2D Laser and Robot's Kinematic Parameters Using Three Planar Constraints,"  Industrial robots are increasingly used in various applications where the
robot accuracy becomes very important, hence calibrations of the robot's
kinematic parameters and the measurement system's extrinsic parameters are
required. However, the existing calibration approaches are either too
cumbersome or require another expensive external measurement system such as
laser tracker or measurement spinarm. In this paper, we propose SCALAR, a
calibration method to simultaneously improve the kinematic parameters of a
6-DoF robot and the extrinsic parameters of a 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF) which
is attached to the robot. Three flat planes are placed around the robot, and
for each plane the robot moves to several poses such that the LRF's ray
intersect the respective plane. Geometric planar constraints are then used to
optimize the calibration parameters using Levenberg- Marquardt nonlinear
optimization algorithm. We demonstrate through simulations that SCALAR can
reduce the average position and orientation errors of the robot system from
14.6mm and 4.05 degrees to 0.09mm and 0.02 degrees.
"
21373,"Twitter adoption, students perceptions, Big Five personality traits and learning outcome: Lessons learned from 3 case studies","  This study presents the results of the introduction of Twitter in the
educational process. It examines the relationship of the tool s use with the
participants learning outcome through a series of well-organized activities.
Three studies were conducted in the context of 2 academic courses. The
participation in the Twitter activity was voluntarily for the students. In all
3 studies the students who participated in the process had a higher laboratory
grade than the students who did not participated. Students Conscientiousness
and Openness to experience were related to their activity in one study.
However, no relationship between the students personality traits and their
grade was unveiled. Moreover, the students interventions in the activities are
examined as well as the variation in their attitudes towards social media use
in learning. The implications of the conducted studies are discussed
extensively and a comparison with other related studies is presented.
"
21374,Entropic theory of Gravitation,"  We construct a manifestly Machian theory of gravitation on the foundation
that information in the universe cannot be destroyed (Landauer's principle). If
no bit of information in the Universe is lost, than the sum of the entropies of
the geometric and the matter fields should be conserved. We propose a local
invariant expression for the entropy of the geometric field and formulate a
variational principle on the entropic functional which produces entropic field
equations. This information-theoretic approach implies that the geometric field
does not exist in an empty of matter Universe, the material entropy is geometry
dependent, matter can exchange information (entropy) with the geometric field
and a quantum condensate can channel energy into the geometric field at a
particular coherent state. The entropic field equations feature a non-intuitive
direct coupling between the material fields and the geometric field, which acts
as an entropy reservoir. Cosmological consequences such as the emergence of the
cosmological constant as well as experimental consequences involving
gravity-quantum condensate interaction are discussed. The energetic aspect of
the theory restores the repertoire of the classical General Relativity up to a
different coupling constant between the fields.
"
21375,Understanding International Migration using Tensor Factorization,"  Understanding human migration is of great interest to demographers and social
scientists. User generated digital data has made it easier to study such
patterns at a global scale. Geo coded Twitter data, in particular, has been
shown to be a promising source to analyse large scale human migration. But
given the scale of these datasets, a lot of manual effort has to be put into
processing and getting actionable insights from this data.
In this paper, we explore feasibility of using a new tool, tensor
decomposition, to understand trends in global human migration. We model human
migration as a three mode tensor, consisting of (origin country, destination
country, time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to get meaningful low
dimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5
years and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration
patterns.
"
21376,Fiber-dependent deautonomization of integrable 2D mappings and discrete Painlevé equations,"  It is well known that two-dimensional mappings preserving a rational elliptic
fibration, like the Quispel-Roberts-Thompson mappings, can be deautonomized to
discrete Painlevé equations. However, the dependence of this procedure on the
choice of a particular elliptic fiber has not been sufficiently investigated.
In this paper we establish a way of performing the deautonomization for a pair
of an autonomous mapping and a fiber. %By choosing a particular Starting from a
single autonomous mapping but varying the type of a chosen fiber, we obtain
different types of discrete Painlevé equations using this deautonomization
procedure. We also introduce a technique for reconstructing a mapping from the
knowledge of its induced action on the Picard group and some additional
geometric data. This technique allows us to obtain factorized expressions of
discrete Painlevé equations, including the elliptic case. Further, by
imposing certain restrictions on such non-autonomous mappings we obtain new and
simple elliptic difference Painlevé equations, including examples whose
symmetry groups do not appear explicitly in Sakai's classification.
"
21377,ZnO and ZnO$_{1-x}$ based thin film memristors: The effects of oxygen deficiency and thickness in resistive switching behavior,"  In this study, direct-current reactive sputtered ZnO and ZnO1-x based thin
film (30 nm and 300 nm in thickness) memristor devices were produced and the
effects of oxygen vacancies and thickness on the memristive characteristics
were investigated. The oxygen deficiency of the ZnO1-x structure was confirmed
by SIMS analyses. The memristive characteristics of both the ZnO and ZnO1-x
devices were determined by time dependent current-voltage (I-V-t) measurements.
The distinctive pinched hysteresis I-V loops of memristors were observed in all
the fabricated devices. The typical homogeneous interface and filamentary types
of memristive behaviors were compared. In addition, conduction mechanisms,
on/off ratios and the compliance current were analyzed. The 30 nm ZnO based
devices with native oxygen vacancies showed the best on/off ratio. All of the
devices exhibited dominant Schottky emissions and weaker Poole-Frenkel
conduction mechanisms. Results suggested that the oxygen deficiency was
responsible for the Schottky emission mechanism. Moreover, the compliance
currents of the devices were related to the decreasing power consumption as the
oxygen vacancies increased.
"
21378,Infrastructure Quality Assessment in Africa using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning,"  The UN Sustainable Development Goals allude to the importance of
infrastructure quality in three of its seventeen goals. However, monitoring
infrastructure quality in developing regions remains prohibitively expensive
and impedes efforts to measure progress toward these goals. To this end, we
investigate the use of widely available remote sensing data for the prediction
of infrastructure quality in Africa. We train a convolutional neural network to
predict ground truth labels from the Afrobarometer Round 6 survey using Landsat
8 and Sentinel 1 satellite imagery.
Our best models predict infrastructure quality with AUROC scores of 0.881 on
Electricity, 0.862 on Sewerage, 0.739 on Piped Water, and 0.786 on Roads using
Landsat 8. These performances are significantly better than models that
leverage OpenStreetMap or nighttime light intensity on the same tasks. We also
demonstrate that our trained model can accurately make predictions in an unseen
country after fine-tuning on a small sample of images. Furthermore, the model
can be deployed in regions with limited samples to predict infrastructure
outcomes with higher performance than nearest neighbor spatial interpolation.
"
21379,Fréchet Means and Procrustes Analysis in Wasserstein Space,"  We consider two statistical problems at the intersection of functional and
non-Euclidean data analysis: the determination of a Fréchet mean in the
Wasserstein space of multivariate distributions; and the optimal registration
of deformed random measures and point processes. We elucidate how the two
problems are linked, each being in a sense dual to the other. We first study
the finite sample version of the problem in the continuum. Exploiting the
tangent bundle structure of Wasserstein space, we deduce the Fréchet mean via
gradient descent. We show that this is equivalent to a Procrustes analysis for
the registration maps, thus only requiring successive solutions to pairwise
optimal coupling problems. We then study the population version of the problem,
focussing on inference and stability: in practice, the data are i.i.d.
realisations from a law on Wasserstein space, and indeed their observation is
discrete, where one observes a proxy finite sample or point process. We
construct regularised nonparametric estimators, and prove their consistency for
the population mean, and uniform consistency for the population Procrustes
registration maps.
"
21380,Sliding-Window Superposition Coding:Two-User Interference Channels,"  A low-complexity coding scheme is developed to achieve the rate region of
maximum likelihood decoding for interference channels. As in the classical
rate-splitting multiple access scheme by Grant, Rimoldi, Urbanke, and Whiting,
the proposed coding scheme uses superposition of multiple codewords with
successive cancellation decoding, which can be implemented using standard
point-to-point encoders and decoders. Unlike rate-splitting multiple access,
which is not rate-optimal for multiple receivers, the proposed coding scheme
transmits codewords over multiple blocks in a staggered manner and recovers
them successively over sliding decoding windows, achieving the single-stream
optimal rate region as well as the more general Han--Kobayashi inner bound for
the two-user interference channel. The feasibility of this scheme in practice
is verified by implementing it using commercial channel codes over the two-user
Gaussian interference channel.
"
21381,Introspective Generative Modeling: Decide Discriminatively,"  We study unsupervised learning by developing introspective generative
modeling (IGM) that attains a generator using progressively learned deep
convolutional neural networks. The generator is itself a discriminator, capable
of introspection: being able to self-evaluate the difference between its
generated samples and the given training data. When followed by repeated
discriminative learning, desirable properties of modern discriminative
classifiers are directly inherited by the generator. IGM learns a cascade of
CNN classifiers using a synthesis-by-classification algorithm. In the
experiments, we observe encouraging results on a number of applications
including texture modeling, artistic style transferring, face modeling, and
semi-supervised learning.
"
21382,Counting submodules of a module over a noetherian commutative ring,"  We count the number of submodules of an arbitrary module over a countable
noetherian commutative ring. We give, along the way, a structural description
of meager modules, which are defined as those that do not have the square of a
simple module as subquotient, and deduce in particular a characterization of
uniserial modules over commutative noetherian rings.
"
21383,Modelling the Influence of Cultural Information on Vision-Based Human Home Activity Recognition,"  Daily life activities, such as eating and sleeping, are deeply influenced by
a person's culture, hence generating differences in the way a same activity is
performed by individuals belonging to different cultures. We argue that taking
cultural information into account can improve the performance of systems for
the automated recognition of human activities. We propose four different
solutions to the problem and present a system which uses a Naive Bayes model to
associate cultural information with semantic information extracted from still
images. Preliminary experiments with a dataset of images of individuals lying
on the floor, sleeping on a futon and sleeping on a bed suggest that: i)
solutions explicitly taking cultural information into account are more accurate
than culture-unaware solutions; and ii) the proposed system is a promising
starting point for the development of culture-aware Human Activity Recognition
methods.
"
21384,Image classification using local tensor singular value decompositions,"  From linear classifiers to neural networks, image classification has been a
widely explored topic in mathematics, and many algorithms have proven to be
effective classifiers. However, the most accurate classifiers typically have
significantly high storage costs, or require complicated procedures that may be
computationally expensive. We present a novel (nonlinear) classification
approach using truncation of local tensor singular value decompositions (tSVD)
that robustly offers accurate results, while maintaining manageable storage
costs. Our approach takes advantage of the optimality of the representation
under the tensor algebra described to determine to which class an image
belongs. We extend our approach to a method that can determine specific
pairwise match scores, which could be useful in, for example, object
recognition problems where pose/position are different. We demonstrate the
promise of our new techniques on the MNIST data set.
"
21385,Short term unpredictability of high Reynolds number turbulence --- rough dependence on initial data,"  Short term unpredictability is discovered numerically for high Reynolds
number fluid flows under periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, the
abundance of the short term unpredictability is also discovered. These
discoveries support our theory that fully developed turbulence is constantly
driven by such short term unpredictability.
"
21386,A Three-Dimensional Mathematical Model of Collagen Contraction,"  In this paper, we introduce a three-dimensional mathematical model of
collagen contraction with microbuckling based on the two-dimensional model
previously developed by the authors. The model both qualitatively and
quantitatively replicates experimental data including lattice contraction over
a time course of 40 hours for lattices with various cell densities, cell
density profiles within contracted lattices, radial cut angles in lattices, and
cell force propagation within a lattice. The importance of the model lattice
formation and the crucial nature of its connectivity are discussed including
differences with models which do not include microbuckling. The model suggests
that most cells within contracting lattices are engaged in directed motion.
"
21387,"Freeze Casting: A Review of Processing, Microstructure and Properties via the Open Data Repository, FreezeCasting.net","  Freeze-casting produces materials with complex, three-dimensional pore
structures which may be tuned during the solidification process. The range of
potential applications of freeze-cast materials is vast, and includes:
structural materials, biomaterials, filtration membranes, pharmaceuticals, and
foodstuffs. Fabrication of materials with application-specific microstructures
is possible via freeze casting, however, the templating process is highly
complex and the underlying principles are only partially understood. Here, we
report the creation of a freeze-casting experimental data repository, which
contains data extracted from ~800 different freeze-casting papers (as of August
2017). These data pertain to variables that link processing conditions to
microstructural characteristics, and finally, mechanical properties. The aim of
this work is to facilitate broad dissemination of relevant data to
freeze-casting researchers, promote better informed experimental design, and
encourage modeling efforts that relate processing conditions to microstructure
formation and material properties. An initial, systematic analysis of these
data is provided and key processing-structure-property relationships posited in
the freeze-casting literature are discussed and tested against the database.
Tools for data visualization and exploration available through the web
interface are also provided.
"
21388,On existence and approximation of solution of nonlinear Hilfer fractional differential equation,"  This paper gives the existence and uniqueness results for solution of
fractional differential equations with Hilfer derivative. Using some new
techniques and generalizing the restrictive conditions imposed on considered
function, the iterative scheme for uniformly approximating the solution is
established.
"
21389,The congruence subgroup problem for a family of branch groups,"  We construct a family of groups which generalize the Hanoi towers group and
study the congruence subgroup problem for the groups in this family. We show
that unlike the Hanoi towers group, the groups in this generalization are just
infinite and have trivial rigid kernel. We also put strict bounds on the branch
kernel. Additionally, we show that these groups have subgroups of finite index
with non-trivial rigid kernel. The only previously known group where this
kernel is non-trivial is the Hanoi towers group and so this adds infinitely
many new examples. Finally, we show that the topological closures of these
groups have Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily close to 1.
"
21390,Character formulae in category $\mathcal O$ for exceptional Lie superalgebras $D(2|1;ζ)$,"  We establish character formulae for representations of the one-parameter
family of simple Lie superalgebras $D(2|1;\zeta)$. We provide a complete
description of the Verma flag multiplicities of the tilting modules and the
projective modules in the BGG category $\mathcal O$ of $D(2|1;\zeta)$-modules
of integral weights, for any complex parameter $\zeta$. The composition factors
of all Verma modules in $\mathcal O$ are then obtained.
"
21391,The M33 Synoptic Stellar Survey. II. Mira Variables,"  We present the discovery of 1847 Mira candidates in the Local Group galaxy
M33 using a novel semi-parametric periodogram technique coupled with a Random
Forest classifier. The algorithms were applied to ~2.4x10^5 I-band light curves
previously obtained by the M33 Synoptic Stellar Survey. We derive preliminary
Period-Luminosity relations at optical, near- & mid-infrared wavelengths and
compare them to the corresponding relations in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
"
21392,Photometry of the long period dwarf nova GY Hya,"  Although comparatively bright, the cataclysmic variable GY Hya has not
attracted much attention in the past. As part of a project to better
characterize such systems photometrically, we observed light curves in white
light, each spanning several hours, at Bronberg Observatory, South Africa, in
2004 and 2005, and at the Observatório do Pico dos Dias, Brazil, in 2014 and
2016. These data permit to study orbital modulations and their variations from
season to season. The orbital period, already known from spectroscopic
observations of Peters & Thorstensen (2005), is confirmed through strong
ellipsoidal variations of the mass donor star in the system and the presence of
eclipses of both components. A refined period of 0.34723972~(6) days and
revised ephemeris are derived. Seasonal changes in the average orbital light
curve can qualitatively be explained by variations of the contribution of a hot
spot to the system light together with changes of the disk radius. The
amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations and the eclipse contact phases permit
to put some constraints on the mass ratio, orbital inclination and the relative
brightness of the primary and secondary components. There are some indications
that the disk radius during quiescence, expressed in units of the component
separation, is smaller than in other dwarf novae.
"
21393,Network Structure Explains the Impact of Attitudes on Voting Decisions,"  Attitudes can have a profound impact on socially relevant behaviours, such as
voting. However, this effect is not uniform across situations or individuals,
and it is at present difficult to predict whether attitudes will predict
behaviour in any given circumstance. Using a network model, we demonstrate that
(a) more strongly connected attitude networks have a stronger impact on
behaviour, and (b) within any given attitude network, the most central attitude
elements have the strongest impact. We test these hypotheses using data on
voting and attitudes toward presidential candidates in the US presidential
elections from 1980 to 2012. These analyses confirm that the predictive value
of attitude networks depends almost entirely on their level of connectivity,
with more central attitude elements having stronger impact. The impact of
attitudes on voting behaviour can thus be reliably determined before elections
take place by using network analyses.
"
21394,Causal inference for social network data,"  We extend recent work by van der Laan (2014) on causal inference for causally
connected units to more general social network settings. Our asymptotic results
allow for dependence of each observation on a growing number of other units as
sample size increases. We are not aware of any previous methods for inference
about network members in observational settings that allow the number of ties
per node to increase as the network grows. While previous methods have
generally implicitly focused on one of two possible sources of dependence among
social network observations, we allow for both dependence due to contagion, or
transmission of information across network ties, and for dependence due to
latent similarities among nodes sharing ties. We describe estimation and
inference for causal effects that are specifically of interest in social
network settings.
"
21395,Differential equations and the algebra of confluent spherical functions on semisimple Lie groups,"  We consider the notion of a confluent spherical function on a connected
semisimple Lie group, $G,$ with finite center and of real rank $1,$ and discuss
the properties and relationship of its algebra with the well-known Schwartz
algebra of spherical functions on $G.$
"
21396,AMORPH: A statistical program for characterizing amorphous materials by X-ray diffraction,"  AMORPH utilizes a new Bayesian statistical approach to interpreting X-ray
diffraction results of samples with both crystalline and amorphous components.
AMORPH fits X-ray diffraction patterns with a mixture of narrow and wide
components, simultaneously inferring all of the model parameters and
quantifying their uncertainties. The program simulates background patterns
previously applied manually, providing reproducible results, and significantly
reducing inter- and intra-user biases. This approach allows for the
quantification of amorphous and crystalline materials and for the
characterization of the amorphous component, including properties such as the
centre of mass, width, skewness, and nongaussianity of the amorphous component.
Results demonstrate the applicability of this program for calculating amorphous
contents of volcanic materials and independently modeling their properties in
compositionally variable materials.
"
21397,Unsupervised Adaptation with Domain Separation Networks for Robust Speech Recognition,"  Unsupervised domain adaptation of speech signal aims at adapting a
well-trained source-domain acoustic model to the unlabeled data from target
domain. This can be achieved by adversarial training of deep neural network
(DNN) acoustic models to learn an intermediate deep representation that is both
senone-discriminative and domain-invariant. Specifically, the DNN is trained to
jointly optimize the primary task of senone classification and the secondary
task of domain classification with adversarial objective functions. In this
work, instead of only focusing on learning a domain-invariant feature (i.e. the
shared component between domains), we also characterize the difference between
the source and target domain distributions by explicitly modeling the private
component of each domain through a private component extractor DNN. The private
component is trained to be orthogonal with the shared component and thus
implicitly increases the degree of domain-invariance of the shared component. A
reconstructor DNN is used to reconstruct the original speech feature from the
private and shared components as a regularization. This domain separation
framework is applied to the unsupervised environment adaptation task and
achieved 11.08% relative WER reduction from the gradient reversal layer
training, a representative adversarial training method, for automatic speech
recognition on CHiME-3 dataset.
"
21398,Robust Power System Dynamic State Estimator with Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise: Part I--Theory,"  This paper develops the theoretical framework and the equations of a new
robust Generalized Maximum-likelihood-type Unscented Kalman Filter (GM-UKF)
that is able to suppress observation and innovation outliers while filtering
out non-Gaussian measurement noise. Because the errors of the real and reactive
power measurements calculated using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) follow
long-tailed probability distributions, the conventional UKF provides strongly
biased state estimates since it relies on the weighted least squares estimator.
By contrast, the state estimates and residuals of our GM-UKF are proved to be
roughly Gaussian, allowing the sigma points to reliably approximate the mean
and the covariance matrices of the predicted and corrected state vectors. To
develop our GM-UKF, we first derive a batch-mode regression form by processing
the predictions and observations simultaneously, where the statistical
linearization approach is used. We show that the set of equations so derived
are equivalent to those of the unscented transformation. Then, a robust
GM-estimator that minimizes a convex Huber cost function while using weights
calculated via Projection Statistics (PS's) is proposed. The PS's are applied
to a two-dimensional matrix that consists of serially correlated predicted
state and innovation vectors to detect observation and innovation outliers.
These outliers are suppressed by the GM-estimator using the iteratively
reweighted least squares algorithm. Finally, the asymptotic error covariance
matrix of the GM-UKF state estimates is derived from the total influence
function. In the companion paper, extensive simulation results will be shown to
verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
"
21399,Equivariant Algebraic Index Theorem,"  We prove a {\Gamma}-equivariant version of the algebraic index theorem, where
{\Gamma} is a discrete group of automorphisms of a formal deformation of a
symplectic manifold. The particular cases of this result are the algebraic
version of the transversal index theorem related to the theorem of A. Connes
and H. Moscovici for hypoelliptic operators and the index theorem for the
extension of the algebra of pseudodifferential operators by a group of
diffeomorphisms of the underlying manifold due to A. Savin, B. Sternin, E.
Schrohe and D. Perrot.

21400,Partially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) Method for Turbulence Simulations: Near-wall Modeling and Smooth-surface Separation Computations,"  The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the PANS model capabilities
in providing significant improvement over RANS predictions at slightly higher
computational expense and producing LES quality results at significantly lower
computational cost. The objectives of this study are: (i) investigate the model
fidelity at a fixed level of scale resolution (Generation1-PANS/G1-PANS) for
smooth surface separation, (ii) Derive the PANS closure model in regions of
resolution variation (Generation2-PANS/G2-PANS), and (iii) Validate G2-PANS
model for attached and separated flows. The separated flows considered in this
study have been designated as critical benchmark flows by NASA CFD study group.
The key contributions of this dissertation are summarized as follows. The
turbulence closure model of varying resolution, G2-PANS, is developed by
deriving mathematically-consistent commutation residues and using energy
conservation principles. The log-layer recovery and accurate computation of
Reynolds stress anisotropy is accomplished by transitioning from steady RANS to
scaled resolved simulations using the G2-PANS model. Finally, several
smooth-separation flows on the NASA turbulence website have been computed with
high degree of accuracy at a significantly reduced computational effort over
LES using the G1-PANS and G2-PANS models.

21401,Stochastic Approximation of Smooth and Strongly Convex Functions: Beyond the $O(1/T)$ Convergence Rate,"  Stochastic approximation (SA) is a classical approach for stochastic convex
optimization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of
SA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity
condition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity
simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\lambda$ be the modulus of
strong convexity, $\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk,
and $\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in
expectation, an $O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha] + \kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is
attainable when $T = \Omega(\kappa^\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the
convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\lambda T])$ and approaches
$O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from
small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound
is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching
$O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we
emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with
an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.
"
21402,A new approach to hierarchical data analysis: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for the causal effect of a cluster-level exposure,"  We often seek to estimate the impact of an exposure naturally occurring or
randomly assigned at the cluster-level. For example, the literature on
neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community
randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation,
sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven
individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are
correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well
as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and
efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two
targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed
under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions
between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct
transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's
covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE
is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and
individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding.
Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential
gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during
estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that
estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in
an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation
is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We
illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.
"
21403,Excitation spectrum and Density Matrix Renormalization Group iterations,"  We show that, in certain circumstances, exact excitation energies appear as
locally site-independent (or flat) modes if one records the excitation spectrum
of the effective Hamiltonian while sweeping through the lattice in the
variational Matrix Product State formulation of the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG), a remarkable property since the effective
Hamiltonian is only constructed to target the ground state. Conversely, modes
that are very flat over several consecutive iterations are systematically found
to correspond to faithful excitations. We suggest to use this property to
extract accurate information about excited states using the standard ground
state algorithm. The results are spectacular for critical systems, for which
the low-energy conformal tower of states can be obtained very accurately at
essentially no additional cost, as demonstrated by confirming the predictions
of boundary conformal field theory for two simple minimal models - the
transverse-field Ising model and the critical three-state Potts model. This
approach is also very efficient to detect the quasi-degenerate low-energy
excitations in topological phases, and to identify localized excitations in
systems with impurities. Finally, using the variance of the Hamiltonian as a
criterion, we assess the accuracy of the resulting Matrix Product State
representations of the excited states.
"
21404,Minimax estimation in linear models with unknown finite alphabet design,"  We provide minimax theory for joint estimation of $F$ and $\omega$ in linear
models $Y = F \omega + Z$ where the parameter matrix $\omega$ and the design
matrix $F$ are unknown but the latter takes values in a known finite set. We
show that this allows to separate $F$ and $\omega$ uniquely under weak
identifiability conditions, a task which is not doable, in general. These
assumptions are justified in a variety of applications, ranging from signal
processing to cancer genetics. We then obtain in the noiseless case, that is,
$Z = 0$, stable recovery of $F$ and $\omega$ in a neighborhood of $Y$. Based on
this, we show for Gaussian error matrix $Z$ that the LSE attains minimax rates
for both, prediction error of $F \omega$ and estimation error of $F$ and
$\omega$, separately. Due to the finite alphabet, estimation of $F$ amounts to
a classification problem, where we show that the classification error
$P(\hat{F} \neq F)$ decreases exponentially in the dimension of one component
of $Y$.
"
21405,Rooted trees with the same plucking polynomial,"  In this paper we give a sufficient and necessary condition for two rooted
trees with the same plucking polynomial. Furthermore, we give a criteria for a
sequence of non-negative integers to be realized as a rooted tree.
"
21406,CityPersons: A Diverse Dataset for Pedestrian Detection,"  Convnets have enabled significant progress in pedestrian detection recently,
but there are still open questions regarding suitable architectures and
training data. We revisit CNN design and point out key adaptations, enabling
plain FasterRCNN to obtain state-of-the-art results on the Caltech dataset.
To achieve further improvement from more and better data, we introduce
CityPersons, a new set of person annotations on top of the Cityscapes dataset.
The diversity of CityPersons allows us for the first time to train one single
CNN model that generalizes well over multiple benchmarks. Moreover, with
additional training with CityPersons, we obtain top results using FasterRCNN on
Caltech, improving especially for more difficult cases (heavy occlusion and
small scale) and providing higher localization quality.
"
21407,The Better Half of Selling Separately,"  Separate selling of two independent goods is shown to yield at least 62% of
the optimal revenue, and at least 73% when the goods satisfy the Myerson
regularity condition. This improves the 50% result of Hart and Nisan (2017,
originally circulated in 2012).
"
21408,Coulomb GANs: Provably Optimal Nash Equilibria via Potential Fields,"  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) evolved into one of the most
successful unsupervised techniques for generating realistic images. Even though
it has recently been shown that GAN training converges, GAN models often end up
in local Nash equilibria that are associated with mode collapse or otherwise
fail to model the target distribution. We introduce Coulomb GANs, which pose
the GAN learning problem as a potential field of charged particles, where
generated samples are attracted to training set samples but repel each other.
The discriminator learns a potential field while the generator decreases the
energy by moving its samples along the vector (force) field determined by the
gradient of the potential field. Through decreasing the energy, the GAN model
learns to generate samples according to the whole target distribution and does
not only cover some of its modes. We prove that Coulomb GANs possess only one
Nash equilibrium which is optimal in the sense that the model distribution
equals the target distribution. We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on a
variety of image datasets. On LSUN and celebA, Coulomb GANs set a new state of
the art and produce a previously unseen variety of different samples.
"
21409,Involution on pseudoisotopy spaces and the space of the nonnegatively curved metrics,"  We prove that certain involutions defined by Vogell and Burghelea-Fiedorowicz
on the rational algebraic K-theory of spaces coincide. This gives a way to
compute the positive and negative eigenspaces of the involution on rational
homotopy groups of pseudoisotopy spaces from the involution on rational
$S^{1}$--homology group of the free loop space of a simply-connected manifold.
As an application, we give explicit dimensions of the open manifolds $V$ that
appear in Belegradek-Farrell-Kapovitch's work for which the spaces of complete
nonnegatively curved metrics on $V$ have nontrivial rational homotopy groups.
"
21410,A class of semisimple Hopf algebras acting on quantum polynomial algebras,"  We construct a class of non-commutative, non-cocommutative, semisimple Hopf
algebras of dimension $2n^2$ and present conditions to define an inner faithful
action of these Hopf algebras on quantum polynomial algebras, providing, in
this way, more examples of semisimple Hopf actions which do not factor through
group actions. Also, under certain condition, we classify the inner faithful
Hopf actions of the Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebra of dimension $8$, $H_8$, on the
quantum plane.
"
21411,Fusion systems of blocks with nontrivial strongly closed subgroups,"  In this paper, we find some exotic fusion systems which have non-trivial
strongly closed subgroups, and we prove these fusion systems are also not
realizable by p-blocks of finite groups.
"
21412,Nonequilibrium steady states and transient dynamics of conventional superconductors under phonon driving,"  We perform a systematic analysis of the influence of phonon driving on the
superconducting Holstein model coupled to heat baths by studying both the
transient dynamics and the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) in the weak and
strong electron-phonon coupling regimes. Our study is based on the
nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, and for the NESS we present a
Floquet formulation adapted to electron-phonon systems. The analysis of the
phonon propagator suggests that the effective attractive interaction can be
strongly enhanced in a parametric resonant regime because of the Floquet side
bands of phonons. While this may be expected to enhance the superconductivity
(SC), our fully self-consistent calculations, which include the effects of
heating and nonthermal distributions, show that the parametric phonon driving
generically results in a suppression or complete melting of the SC order. In
the strong coupling regime, the NESS always shows a suppression of the SC gap,
the SC order parameter and the superfluid density as a result of the driving,
and this tendency is most prominent at the parametric resonance. Using the
real-time nonequilibrium DMFT formalism, we also study the dynamics towards the
NESS, which shows that the heating effect dominates the transient dynamics, and
SC is weakened by the external modulations, in particular at the parametric
resonance. In the weak coupling regime, we find that the SC fluctuations above
the transition temperature are generally weakened under the driving. The
strongest suppression occurs again around the parametric resonances because of
the efficient energy absorption.
"
21413,Optimal Portfolio in Intraday Electricity Markets Modelled by Lévy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes,"  We study an optimal portfolio problem designed for an agent operating in
intraday electricity markets. The investor is allowed to trade in a single
risky asset modelling the continuously traded power and aims to maximize the
expected terminal utility of his wealth. We assume a mean-reverting additive
process to drive the power prices. In the case of logarithmic utility, we
reduce the fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to a linear
parabolic integro-differential equation, for which we explicitly exhibit a
classical solution in two cases of modelling interest. The optimal strategy is
given implicitly as the solution of an integral equation, which is possible to
solve numerically as well as to describe analytically. An analysis of two
different approximations for the optimal policy is provided. Finally, we
perform a numerical test by adapting the parameters of a popular electricity
spot price model.
"
21414,Topological phase transitions in small mesoscopic chiral p-wave superconductors,"  Spin-triplet chiral p-wave superconductivity is typically described by a
two-component order parameter, and as such is prone to unique emergent effects
when compared to the standard single-component superconductors. Here we present
the equilibrium phase diagram for small mesoscopic chiral p-wave
superconducting disks in the presence of magnetic field, obtained by solving
the microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently. In the
ultra-small limit, the cylindrically-symmetric giant-vortex states are the
ground state of the system. However, with increasing sample size, the
cylindrical symmetry is broken as the two components of the order parameter
segregate into domains, and the number of fragmented domain walls between them
characterizes the resulting states. Such domain walls are topological defects
unique for the p-wave order, and constitute a dominant phase in the mesoscopic
regime. Moreover, we find two possible types of domain walls, identified by
their chirality-dependent interaction with the edge states.
"
21415,Squeezing on momentum states for atom interferometry,"  We propose and analyse a method that allows for the production of squeezed
states of the atomic center-of-mass motion that can be injected into an atom
interferometer. Our scheme employs dispersive probing in a ring resonator on a
narrow transition of strontium atoms in order to provide a collective
measurement of the relative population of two momentum states. We show that
this method is applicable to a Bragg diffraction-based atom interferometer with
large diffraction orders. The applicability of this technique can be extended
also to small diffraction orders and large atom numbers by inducing atomic
transparency at the frequency of the probe field, reaching an interferometer
phase resolution scaling $\Delta\phi\sim N^{-3/4}$, where $N$ is the atom
number. We show that for realistic parameters it is possible to obtain a 20 dB
gain in interferometer phase estimation compared to the Standard Quantum Limit.
"
21416,Synthesis of Near-regular Natural Textures,"  Texture synthesis is widely used in the field of computer graphics, vision,
and image processing. In the present paper, a texture synthesis algorithm is
proposed for near-regular natural textures with the help of a representative
periodic pattern extracted from the input textures using distance matching
function. Local texture statistics is then analyzed against global texture
statistics for non-overlapping windows of size same as periodic pattern size
and a representative periodic pattern is extracted from the image and used for
texture synthesis, while preserving the global regularity and visual
appearance. Validation of the algorithm based on experiments with synthetic
textures whose periodic pattern sizes are known and containing camouflages /
defects proves the strength of the algorithm for texture synthesis and its
application in detection of camouflages / defects in textures.
"
21417,The Uncertainty Bellman Equation and Exploration,"  We consider the exploration/exploitation problem in reinforcement learning.
For exploitation, it is well known that the Bellman equation connects the value
at any time-step to the expected value at subsequent time-steps. In this paper
we consider a similar \textit{uncertainty} Bellman equation (UBE), which
connects the uncertainty at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at
subsequent time-steps, thereby extending the potential exploratory benefit of a
policy beyond individual time-steps. We prove that the unique fixed point of
the UBE yields an upper bound on the variance of the posterior distribution of
the Q-values induced by any policy. This bound can be much tighter than
traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard deviation rather than
variance. Importantly, and unlike several existing approaches to optimism, this
method scales naturally to large systems with complex generalization.
Substituting our UBE-exploration strategy for $\epsilon$-greedy improves DQN
performance on 51 out of 57 games in the Atari suite.
"
21418,Syntax-Preserving Belief Change Operators for Logic Programs,"  Recent methods have adapted the well-established AGM and belief base
frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In
this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic
programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the
rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches
that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the
latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties
for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial
meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which
allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and
support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more
information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones,
but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the
first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the
revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to
the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the
belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our
operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a
logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions
to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program.
Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision
methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and
generalise the other method.
"
21419,Mapping degrees between spherical $3$-manifolds,"  Let $D(M,N)$ be the set of integers that can be realized as the degree of a
map between two closed connected orientable manifolds $M$ and $N$ of the same
dimension. For closed $3$-manifolds with $S^3$-geometry $M$ and $N$, every such
degree $deg f\equiv \overline{deg}\psi$ $(|\pi_1(N)|)$ where $0\le
\overline{deg}\psi <|\pi_1(N)|$ and $\overline{deg}\psi$ only depends on the
induced homomorphism $\psi=f_{\pi}$ on the fundamental group. In this paper, we
calculate explicitly the set $\{\overline{deg}\psi\}$ when $\psi$ is surjective
and then we show how to determine $\overline{deg}(\psi)$ for arbitrary
homomorphisms. This leads to the determination of the set $D(M,N)$.
"
21420,Estimating graph parameters with random walks,"  An algorithm observes the trajectories of random walks over an unknown graph
$G$, starting from the same vertex $x$, as well as the degrees along the
trajectories. For all finite connected graphs, one can estimate the number of
edges $m$ up to a bounded factor in
$O\left(t_{\mathrm{rel}}^{3/4}\sqrt{m/d}\right)$ steps, where
$t_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relaxation time of the lazy random walk on $G$ and
$d$ is the minimum degree in $G$. Alternatively, $m$ can be estimated in
$O\left(t_{\mathrm{unif}} +t_{\mathrm{rel}}^{5/6}\sqrt{n}\right)$, where $n$ is
the number of vertices and $t_{\mathrm{unif}}$ is the uniform mixing time on
$G$. The number of vertices $n$ can then be estimated up to a bounded factor in
an additional $O\left(t_{\mathrm{unif}}\frac{m}{n}\right)$ steps. Our
algorithms are based on counting the number of intersections of random walk
paths $X,Y$, i.e. the number of pairs $(t,s)$ such that $X_t=Y_s$. This
improves on previous estimates which only consider collisions (i.e., times $t$
with $X_t=Y_t$). We also show that the complexity of our algorithms is optimal,
even when restricting to graphs with a prescribed relaxation time. Finally, we
show that, given either $m$ or the mixing time of $G$, we can compute the
""other parameter"" with a self-stopping algorithm.
"
21421,RoI-based Robotic Grasp Detection in Object Overlapping Scenes Using Convolutional Neural Network,"  Grasp detection is an essential skill for widespread use of robots. Recent
works demonstrate the advanced performance of Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) on robotic grasp detection. However, a significant shortcoming of
existing grasp detection algorithms is that they all ignore the affiliation
between grasps and targets. In this paper, we propose a robotic grasp detection
algorithm based on Region of Interest (RoI) to simultaneously detect targets
and their grasps in object overlapping scenes. Our proposed algorithm uses
Regions of Interest (RoIs) to detect grasps while doing classification and
location regression of targets. To train the network, we contribute a much
bigger multi-object grasp dataset than Cornell Grasp Dataset, which is based on
Visual Manipulation Relationship Dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
our algorithm achieves 24.9% miss rate at 1FPPI and 68.2% mAP with grasp on our
dataset. Robotic experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can help
robots grasp specified target in multi-object scenes at 84% success rate.
"
21422,Light Source Point Cluster Selection Based Atmosphere Light Estimation,"  Atmosphere light value is a highly critical parameter in defogging algorithms
that are based on an atmosphere scattering model. Any error in atmosphere light
value will produce a direct impact on the accuracy of scattering computation
and thus bring chromatic distortion to restored images. To address this
problem, this paper propose a method that relies on clustering statistics to
estimate atmosphere light value. It starts by selecting in the original image
some potential atmosphere light source points, which are grouped into point
clusters by means of clustering technique. From these clusters, a number of
clusters containing candidate atmosphere light source points are selected, the
points are then analyzed statistically, and the cluster containing the most
candidate points is used for estimating atmosphere light value. The mean
brightness vector of the candidate atmosphere light points in the chosen point
cluster is taken as the estimate of atmosphere light value, while their
geometric center in the image is accepted as the location of atmosphere light.
Experimental results suggest that this statistics clustering method produces
more accurate atmosphere brightness vectors and light source locations. This
accuracy translates to, from a subjective perspective, more natural defogging
effect on the one hand and to the improvement in various objective image
quality indicators on the other hand.
"
21423,Complete Submodularity Characterization in the Comparative Independent Cascade Model,"  We study the propagation of comparative ideas or items in social networks. A
full characterization for submodularity in the comparative independent cascade
(Com-IC) model of two-idea cascade is given, for competing ideas and
complementary ideas respectively, with or without reconsideration. We further
introduce One-Shot model where agents show less patience toward ideas, and show
that in One-Shot model, only the strongest idea spreads with submodularity.
"
21424,Physics-guided probabilistic modeling of extreme precipitation under climate change,"  Earth System Models (ESMs) are the state of the art for projecting the
effects of climate change. However, longstanding uncertainties in their ability
to simulate regional and local precipitation extremes and related processes
inhibit decision making. Stakeholders would be best supported by probabilistic
projections of changes in extreme precipitation at relevant space-time scales.
Here we propose an empirical Bayesian model that extends an existing skill and
consensus based weighting framework and test the hypothesis that nontrivial,
physics-guided measures of ESM skill can help produce reliable probabilistic
characterization of climate extremes. Specifically, the model leverages
knowledge of physical relationships between temperature, atmospheric moisture
capacity, and extreme precipitation intensity to iteratively weight and combine
ESMs and estimate probability distributions of return levels. Out-of-sample
validation shows evidence that the Bayesian model is a sound method for
deriving reliable probabilistic projections. Beyond precipitation extremes, the
framework may be a basis for a generic, physics-guided approach to modeling
probability distributions of climate variables in general, extremes or
otherwise.
"
21425,LISA Detection of Binary Black Holes in the Milky Way Galaxy,"  Using the black hole merger rate inferred from LIGO, we calculate the
abundance of tightly bound binary black holes in the Milky Way galaxy. Binaries
with a small semimajor axis ($\lesssim 10 R_\odot$) originate at larger
separations through conventional formation mechanisms and evolve as a result of
gravitational wave emission. We find that LISA could detect them in the Milky
Way. We also identify possible X-ray signatures of such binaries.
"
21426,Compacton solutions and (non)integrability for nonlinear evolutionary PDEs associated with a chain of prestressed granules,"  We present the results of study of a nonlinear evolutionary PDE (more
precisely, a one-parameter family of PDEs) associated with the chain of
pre-stressed granules. The PDE in question supports solitary waves of
compression and rarefaction (bright and dark compactons) and can be written in
Hamiltonian form. We investigate {\em inter alia} integrability properties of
this PDE and its generalized symmetries and conservation laws.
For the compacton solutions we perform a stability test followed by the
numerical study. In particular, we simulate the temporal evolution of a single
compacton, and the interactions of compacton pairs. The results of numerical
simulations performed for our model are compared with the numerical evolution
of corresponding Cauchy data for the discrete model of chain of pre-stressed
elastic granules.
"
21427,FormuLog: Datalog for static analysis involving logical formulae,"  Datalog has become a popular language for writing static analyses. Because
Datalog is very limited, some implementations of Datalog for static analysis
have extended it with new language features. However, even with these features
it is hard or impossible to express a large class of analyses because they use
logical formulae to represent program state. FormuLog fills this gap by
extending Datalog to represent, manipulate, and reason about logical formulae.
We have used FormuLog to implement declarative versions of symbolic execution
and abstract model checking, analyses previously out of the scope of
Datalog-based languages. While this paper focuses on the design of FormuLog and
one of the analyses we have implemented in it, it also touches on a prototype
implementation of the language and identifies performance optimizations that we
believe will be necessary to scale FormuLog to real-world static analysis
problems.
"
21428,A Double Parametric Bootstrap Test for Topic Models,"  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique for finding latent
representations of data. The method has been applied to corpora to construct
topic models. However, NMF has likelihood assumptions which are often violated
by real document corpora. We present a double parametric bootstrap test for
evaluating the fit of an NMF-based topic model based on the duality of the KL
divergence and Poisson maximum likelihood estimation. The test correctly
identifies whether a topic model based on an NMF approach yields reliable
results in simulated and real data.
"
21429,Heat flows inferred from a Parker's-like formula for stable or quasi-stable continents,"  Surface heat flow is a key parameter for the geothermal structure, rheology,
and hence the dynamics of continents. However, the coverage of heat flow
measurements is still poor in many continental areas. By transforming the
stable nonlinear heat conduction equation into a Poisson's one, we develop a
method to infer surface heat flow for a stable or quasi-stable continent from a
Parker's-like formula. This formula provides the relationship between the
Fourier transform of surface heat flow and the sum of the Fourier transform of
the powers of geometry for the heat production (HP) interface in the
continental lithosphere. Once the interface geometry is known, one to three
dimensional distribution of the surface heat flow can be calculated accurately
by this formula. As a case study, we estimate the three-dimensional surface
heat flows for the Ordos geological block and its adjacent areas in China on a
$1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ grid based on a simple layered constant HP model.
Comparing to the measurements, most relative errors of the heat flows inferred
are less than 20\%, showing this method is a favorable way to estimate surface
heat flow for stable or quasi-stable continental regions where measurements are
rare or absent.
"
21430,Real-time 3D Reconstruction on Construction Site using Visual SLAM and UAV,"  3D reconstruction can be used as a platform to monitor the performance of
activities on construction site, such as construction progress monitoring,
structure inspection and post-disaster rescue. Comparing to other sensors, RGB
image has the advantages of low-cost, texture rich and easy to implement that
has been used as the primary method for 3D reconstruction in construction
industry. However, the image-based 3D reconstruction always requires extended
time to acquire and/or to process the image data, which limits its application
on time critical projects. Recent progress in Visual Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) make it possible to reconstruct a 3D map of construction
site in real-time. Integrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the obstacles
areas that are inaccessible for the ground equipment can also be sensed.
Despite these advantages of visual SLAM and UAV, until now, such technique has
not been fully investigated on construction site. Therefore, the objective of
this research is to present a pilot study of using visual SLAM and UAV for
real-time construction site reconstruction. The system architecture and the
experimental setup are introduced, and the preliminary results and the
potential applications using Visual SLAM and UAV on construction site are
discussed.
"
21431,The Space of Transferable Adversarial Examples,"  Adversarial examples are maliciously perturbed inputs designed to mislead
machine learning (ML) models at test-time. They often transfer: the same
adversarial example fools more than one model.
In this work, we propose novel methods for estimating the previously unknown
dimensionality of the space of adversarial inputs. We find that adversarial
examples span a contiguous subspace of large (~25) dimensionality. Adversarial
subspaces with higher dimensionality are more likely to intersect. We find that
for two different models, a significant fraction of their subspaces is shared,
thus enabling transferability.
In the first quantitative analysis of the similarity of different models'
decision boundaries, we show that these boundaries are actually close in
arbitrary directions, whether adversarial or benign. We conclude by formally
studying the limits of transferability. We derive (1) sufficient conditions on
the data distribution that imply transferability for simple model classes and
(2) examples of scenarios in which transfer does not occur. These findings
indicate that it may be possible to design defenses against transfer-based
attacks, even for models that are vulnerable to direct attacks.
"
21432,Sensitivity of the entanglement spectrum to boundary conditions as a characterization of the phase transition from delocalization to localization,"  Sensitivity of entanglement Hamiltonian spectrum to boundary conditions is
considered as a phase detection parameter for delocalized-localized phase
transition. By employing one-dimensional models that undergo
delocalized-localized phase transition, we study the shift in the entanglement
energies and the shift in the entanglement entropy when we change boundary
conditions from periodic to anti-periodic. Specifically, we show that both
these quantities show a change of several orders of magnitude at the transition
point in the models considered. Therefore, this shift can be used to indicate
the phase transition points in the models. We also show that both these
quantities can be used to determine \emph{mobility edges} separating localized
and delocalized states.
"
21433,"Radial metal abundance profiles in the intra-cluster medium of cool-core galaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals","  The hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) permeating galaxy clusters and groups is
not pristine, as it is continuously enriched by metals synthesised in Type Ia
(SNIa) and core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae since the major epoch of star
formation (z ~ 2-3). The cluster/group enrichment history and the mechanisms
responsible for releasing and mixing the metals can be probed via the radial
distribution of SNIa and SNcc products within the ICM. In this paper, we use
deep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations from a sample of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy
clusters, groups, and ellipticals (CHEERS) to constrain the average radial O,
Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni abundance profiles. The radial distributions of
all these elements, averaged over a large sample for the first time, represent
the best constrained profiles available currently. We find an overall decrease
of the Fe abundance with radius out to ~$0.9 r_{500}$ and ~$0.6 r_{500}$ for
clusters and groups, respectively, in good agreement with predictions from the
most recent hydrodynamical simulations. The average radial profiles of all the
other elements (X) are also centrally peaked and, when rescaled to their
average central X/Fe ratios, follow well the Fe profile out to at least
~0.5$r_{500}$. Using two sets of SNIa and SNcc yield models reproducing well
the X/Fe abundance pattern in the core, we find that, as predicted by recent
simulations, the relative contribution of SNIa (SNcc) to the total ICM
enrichment is consistent with being uniform at all radii, both for clusters and
groups. In addition to implying that the central metal peak is balanced between
SNIa and SNcc, our results suggest that the enriching SNIa and SNcc products
must share the same origin, and that the delay between the bulk of the SNIa and
SNcc explosions must be shorter than the timescale necessary to diffuse out the
metals.
"
21434,Edge states in dynamical superlattices,"  We address edge states and rich localization regimes available in the
one-dimensional (1D) dynamically modulated superlattices, both theoretically
and numerically. In contrast to conventional lattices with straight waveguides,
the quasi-energy band of infinite modulated superlattice is periodic not only
in the transverse Bloch momentum, but it also changes periodically with
increase of the coupling strength between waveguides. Due to collapse of
quasi-energy bands dynamical superlattices admit known dynamical localization
effect. If, however, such a lattice is truncated, periodic longitudinal
modulation leads to appearance of specific edge states that exist within
certain periodically spaced intervals of coupling constants. We discuss unusual
transport properties of such truncated superlattices and illustrate different
excitation regimes and enhanced robustness of edge states in them, that is
associated with topology of the quasi-energy band.

21435,"On the Monitoring of Decentralized Specifications Semantics, Properties, Analysis, and Simulation","  We define two complementary approaches to monitor decentralized systems. The
first relies on those with a centralized specification, i.e, when the
specification is written for the behavior of the entire system. To do so, our
approach introduces a data-structure that i) keeps track of the execution of an
automaton, ii) has predictable parameters and size, and iii) guarantees strong
eventual consistency. The second approach defines decentralized specifications
wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system.
We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to
monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We
also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications.
We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for
analyzing their behavior. Furthermore, we introduce THEMIS, a framework for
designing such decentralized algorithms and simulating their behavior. We show
the usage of THEMIS to compare multiple algorithms and verify the trends
predicted by the analysis by studying two scenarios: a synthetic benchmark and
a real example.
"
21436,Morphology and the Color-Mass Diagram as Clues to Galaxy Evolution at z~1,"  We study the significance of mergers in the quenching of star formation in
galaxies at z~1 by examining their color-mass distributions for different
morphology types. We perform two-dimensional light profile fits to GOODS iz
images of ~5000 galaxies and X-ray selected active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts
in the CANDELS/GOODS-north and south fields in the redshift range 0.7<z<1.3.
Distinguishing between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated morphologies, we find
that disks and spheroids have distinct color-mass distributions, in agreement
with studies at z~0. The smooth distribution across colors for the disk
galaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event.
Meanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming
disk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is
suggestive of rapid quenching. The distribution of moderate luminosity X-ray
AGN hosts is even across colors, in contrast, and we find similar numbers and
distributions among the two morphology types with no apparent dependence on
Eddington ratio. The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN
in the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the
AGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves
into the green valley. This suggests AGN feedback may play a role in the
quenching of star formation in the minority of galaxies that undergo major
mergers.
"
21437,That's Mine! Learning Ownership Relations and Norms for Robots,"  The ability for autonomous agents to learn and conform to human norms is
crucial for their safety and effectiveness in social environments. While recent
work has led to frameworks for the representation and inference of simple
social rules, research into norm learning remains at an exploratory stage.
Here, we present a robotic system capable of representing, learning, and
inferring ownership relations and norms. Ownership is represented as a graph of
probabilistic relations between objects and their owners, along with a database
of predicate-based norms that constrain the actions permissible on owned
objects. To learn these norms and relations, our system integrates (i) a novel
incremental norm learning algorithm capable of both one-shot learning and
induction from specific examples, (ii) Bayesian inference of ownership
relations in response to apparent rule violations, and (iii) percept-based
prediction of an object's likely owners. Through a series of simulated and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate the competence and flexibility of the
system in performing object manipulation tasks that require a variety of norms
to be followed, laying the groundwork for future research into the acquisition
and application of social norms.
"
21438,Understanding liquid-jet atomization cascades via vortex dynamics,"  Temporal instabilities of a planar liquid jet are studied using direct
numerical simulation (DNS) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with
level-set (LS) and volume-of-fluid (VoF) surface tracking methods. $\lambda_2$
contours are used to relate the vortex dynamics to the surface dynamics at
different stages of the jet breakup, namely, lobe formation, lobe perforation,
ligament formation, stretching, and tearing. Three distinct breakup mechanisms
are identified in the primary breakup, which are well categorized on the
parameter space of gas Weber number ($We_g$) versus liquid Reynolds number
($Re_l$). These mechanisms are analyzed here from a vortex dynamics
perspective. Vortex dynamics explains the hairpin formation, and the
interaction between the hairpins and the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roller explains
the perforation of the lobes, which is attributed to the streamwise overlapping
of two oppositely-oriented hairpin vortices on top and bottom of the lobe. The
formation of corrugations on the lobe front edge at high $Re_l$ is also related
to the location and structure of the hairpins with respect to the KH vortex.
The lobe perforation and corrugation formation are inhibited at low $Re_l$ and
low $We_g$ due to the high surface tension and viscous forces, which damp the
small scale corrugations and resist hole formation. Streamwise vorticity
generation - resulting in three-dimensional instabilities - is mainly caused by
vortex stretching and baroclinic torque at high and low density ratios,
respectively. Generation of streamwise vortices and their interaction with
spanwise vortices produce the liquid structures seen at various flow
conditions. Understanding the liquid sheet breakup and the related vortex
dynamics are crucial for controlling the droplet size distribution in primary
atomization.
"
21439,Multi-kernel learning of deep convolutional features for action recognition,"  Image understanding using deep convolutional network has reached human-level
performance, yet a closely related problem of video understanding especially,
action recognition has not reached the requisite level of maturity. We combine
multi-kernels based support-vector-machines (SVM) with a multi-stream deep
convolutional neural network to achieve close to state-of-the-art performance
on a 51-class activity recognition problem (HMDB-51 dataset); this specific
dataset has proved to be particularly challenging for deep neural networks due
to the heterogeneity in camera viewpoints, video quality, etc. The resulting
architecture is named pillar networks as each (very) deep neural network acts
as a pillar for the hierarchical classifiers. In addition, we illustrate that
hand-crafted features such as improved dense trajectories (iDT) and Multi-skip
Feature Stacking (MIFS), as additional pillars, can further supplement the
performance.
"
21440,"Vector bundles for ""Matrix algebras converge to the sphere""","  In the high-energy quantum-physics literature one finds statements such as
""matrix algebras converge to the sphere"". Earlier I provided a general precise
setting for understanding such statements, in which the matrix algebras are
viewed as quantum metric spaces, and convergence is with respect to a quantum
Gromov-Hausdorff-type distance.
But physicists want even more to treat structures on spheres (and other
spaces), such as vector bundles, Yang-Mills functionals, Dirac operators, etc.,
and they want to approximate these by corresponding structures on matrix
algebras. In the present paper we treat this idea for vector bundles. We
develop a general precise way for understanding how, for two compact quantum
metric spaces that are close together, to a given vector bundle on one of them
there can correspond in a natural way a unique vector bundle on the other. We
then show explicitly how this works for the case of matrix algebras converging
to the 2-sphere.
"
21441,Ehrlich-Schwoebel Effect on the Growth Dynamics of GaAs(111)A surfaces,"  We present a detailed characterization of the growth dynamics of
Ga(Al)As(111)A surfaces. We develop a theoretical growth model that well
describes the observed behavior on the growth parameters and underlines the
Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier as leading factor that determines the growth
dynamics. On such basis we analyze the factors that lead to the huge observed
roughness on such surface orientations and we identify the growth conditions
that drive the typical three-dimensional growth of Ga(Al)As(111)A towards
atomically flat surface. GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells realized on optimized
surface (<0.2 nm roughness) show a record low emission linewidth of 4.5 meV.
"
21442,Warnings and Caveats in Brain Controllability,"  In this work we challenge the main conclusions of Gu et al work
(Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6, 8414,
doi:10.1038/ncomms9414, 2015) on brain controllability. Using the same methods
and analyses on four datasets we find that the minimum set of nodes to control
brain networks is always larger than one. We also find that the relationships
between the average/modal controllability and weighted degrees also hold for
randomized data and the there are not specific roles played by Resting State
Networks in controlling the brain. In conclusion, we show that there is no
evidence that topology plays specific and unique roles in the controllability
of brain networks. Accordingly, Gu et al. interpretation of their results, in
particular in terms of translational applications (e.g. using single node
controllability properties to define target region(s) for neurostimulation)
should be revisited. Though theoretically intriguing, our understanding of the
relationship between controllability and structural brain network remains
elusive.
"
21443,Novelty and Foreseeing Research Trends; The Case of Astrophysics and Astronomy,"  Metrics based on reference lists of research articles or on keywords have
been used to predict citation impact. The concept behind such metrics is that
original ideas stem from the reconfiguration of the structure of past
knowledge, and therefore atypical combinations in the reference lists,
keywords, or classification codes indicate future high impact research. The
current paper serves as an introduction to this line of research for
astronomers and also addresses some methodological questions of this field of
innovation studies. It is still not clear if the choice of particular indexes,
such as references to journals, articles, or specific bibliometric
classification codes would affect the relationship between atypical
combinations and citation impact. To understand more aspects of the innovation
process, a new metric has been devised to measure to what extent researchers
are able to anticipate the changing combinatorial trends of the future. Results
show that the variant of the latter anticipation scores that is based on paper
combinations is a good predictor of future citation impact of scholarly works.
The study also shows that the effect of tested indexes vary with the
aggregation level that was used to construct them. A detailed analysis of
combinatorial novelty in the field reveals that certain sub-fields of astronomy
and astrophysics have different roles in the reconfiguration in past knowledge.
"
21444,A Covert Queueing Channel in Round Robin Schedulers,"  We study a covert queueing channel (CQC) between two users sharing a round
robin scheduler. Such a covert channel can arise when users share a resource
such as a computer processor or a router arbitrated by a round robin policy. We
present an information-theoretic framework to model and derive the maximum
reliable data transmission rate, i.e., the capacity of this channel, for both
noiseless and noisy setups. Our results show that seemingly isolated users can
communicate with a high rate over the covert channel and demonstrate the
possibility of significant information leakage and privacy threats brought by
CQCs in round robin schedulers. Moreover, we propose practical finite-length
code constructions, which achieve the capacity limit.
"
21445,Relative periodic orbits form the backbone of turbulent pipe flow,"  Chaotic dynamics of low-dimensional systems, such as Lorenz or Rössler
flows, is guided by the infinity of periodic orbits embedded in their strange
attractors. Whether this also be the case for the infinite-dimensional dynamics
of Navier--Stokes equations has long been speculated, and is a topic of ongoing
study. Periodic and relative periodic solutions have been shown to be involved
in transitions to turbulence. Their relevance to turbulent
dynamics---specifically, whether periodic orbits play the same role in
high-dimensional nonlinear systems like the Navier--Stokes equations as they do
in lower-dimensional systems---is the focus of the present investigation. We
perform here a detailed study of pipe flow relative periodic orbits with
energies and mean dissipations close to turbulent values. We outline several
approaches to reduction of the translational symmetry of the system. We study
pipe flow in a minimal computational cell, and report a library of invariant
solutions found with the aid of the method of slices. Detailed study of the
unstable manifolds of a sample of these solutions is consistent with the
picture that relative periodic orbits are embedded in the chaotic saddle and
that they guide the turbulent dynamics.
"
21446,Tunable hybridization of Majorana bound states at the quantum spin Hall edge,"  Confinement at the helical edge of a topological insulator is possible in the
presence of proximity-induced magnetic (F) or superconducting (S) order. The
interplay of both phenomena leads to the formation of localized Majorana bound
states (MBS) or likewise (under certain resonance conditions) the formation of
ordinary Andreev bound states (ABS). We investigate the properties of bound
states in junctions composed of alternating regions of F or S barriers.
Interestingly, the direction of magnetization in F regions and the relative
superconducting phase between S regions can be exploited to hybridize MBS or
ABS at will. We show that the local properties of MBS translate into a
particular nonlocal superconducting pairing amplitude. Remarkably, the symmetry
of the pairing amplitude contains information about the nature of the bound
state that it stems from. Hence, this symmetry can in principle be used to
distinguish MBS from ABS, owing to the strong connection between local density
of states and nonlocal pairing in our setup.
"
21447,Vanishing lines for modules over the motivic Steenrod algebra,"  We study criteria for freeness and for the existence of a vanishing line for
modules over certain Hopf subalgebras of the motivic Steenrod algebra over
$\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{C})$ at the prime 2. These turn out to be determined by
the vanishing of certain Margolis homology groups in the quotient Hopf algebra
$\mathcal{A}/\tau$.
"
21448,A 20-Channel Magnetoencephalography System Based on Optically Pumped Magnetometers,"  We describe a multichannel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system that uses
optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to sense the magnetic fields of the human
brain. The system consists of an array of 20 OPM channels conforming to the
human subject's head, a person-sized magnetic shield containing the array and
the human subject, a laser system to drive the OPM array, and various control
and data acquisitions systems. We conducted two MEG experiments: auditory
evoked magnetic field (AEF) and somatosensory evoked magnetic field (SEF), on
three healthy male subjects, using both our OPM array and a 306-channel
Elekta-Neuromag superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) MEG system.
The described OPM array measures the tangential components of the magnetic
field as opposed to the radial component measured by all SQUID-based MEG
systems. Herein we compare the results of the OPM- and SQUID-based MEG systems
on the auditory and somatosensory data recorded in the same individuals on both
systems.
"
21449,A universal negative group delay filter for the prediction of band-limited signals,"  A filter for universal real-time prediction of band-limited signals is
presented. The filter consists of multiple time-delayed feedback terms in order
to accomplish anticipatory coupling, which again leads to a negative group
delay for frequencies in the baseband. The universality of the filter arises
from its property that it does not rely on a specific model of the signal.
Specifically, as long as the signal to be predicted is band-limited with a
known cutoff frequency, the filter order, the only parameter of the filter,
follows and the filter predicts the signal in real time up to a prediction
horizon that depends on the cutoff frequency, too. It is worked out in detail
how signal prediction arises from the negative group delay of the filter. Its
properties, including stability, are investigated theoretically, by numerical
simulations, and by application to a physiological signal. Possible control and
signal processing applications of this filter are discussed.
"
21450,The odd primary order of the commutator on low rank Lie groups,"  Let $G$ be a simply-connected, compact, simple Lie group of low rank relative
to a fixed prime $p$. After localization at $p$, there is a space $A$ which
""generates"" $G$ in a certain sense. Assuming $G$ satisfies a homotopy
nilpotency condition relative to $p$, we show that the Samelson product
$\langle Id_G, Id_G\rangle$ of the identity of $G$ equals the order of the
Samelson product $\langle\imath,\imath\rangle$ of the inclusion $\imath:A\to
G$. Applying this result, we calculate the orders of $\langle Id_G,Id_G\rangle$
for all $p$-regular Lie groups and give bounds on the orders of $\langle
Id_G,Id_G\rangle$ for certain quasi-$p$-regular Lie groups.
"
21451,Communication Complexity of Estimating Correlations,"  We characterize the communication complexity of the following distributed
estimation problem. Alice and Bob observe infinitely many iid copies of
$\rho$-correlated unit-variance (Gaussian or $\pm1$ binary) random variables,
with unknown $\rho\in[-1,1]$. By interactively exchanging $k$ bits, Bob wants
to produce an estimate $\hat\rho$ of $\rho$. We show that the best possible
performance (optimized over interaction protocol $\Pi$ and estimator $\hat
\rho$) satisfies $\inf_{\Pi,\hat\rho}\sup_\rho \mathbb{E} [|\rho-\hat\rho|^2] =
\Theta(\tfrac{1}{k})$. Furthermore, we show that the best possible unbiased
estimator achieves performance of $1+o(1)\over {2k\ln 2}$. Curiously, thus,
restricting communication to $k$ bits results in (order-wise) similar minimax
estimation error as restricting to $k$ samples. Our results also imply an
$\Omega(n)$ lower bound on the information complexity of the Gap-Hamming
problem, for which we show a direct information-theoretic proof.
Notably, the protocol achieving (almost) optimal performance is one-way
(non-interactive). For one-way protocols we also prove the
$\Omega(\tfrac{1}{k})$ bound even when $\rho$ is restricted to any small open
sub-interval of $[-1,1]$ (i.e. a local minimax lower bound). %We do not know if
this local behavior remains true in the interactive setting. Our proof
techniques rely on symmetric strong data-processing inequalities, various
tensorization techniques from information-theoretic interactive
common-randomness extraction, and (for the local lower bound) on the
Otto-Villani estimate for the Wasserstein-continuity of trajectories of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup.
"
21452,"Postponement of raa and Glivenko's theorem, revisited (extended version)","  This article focuses on the technique of postponing the application of the
reduction ad absurdum rule (raa) in classical natural deduction. First, it is
shown how this technique is connected with two normalization strategies for
classical logic: one given by Prawitz, and the other by Seldin. Secondly, a
variant of Seldin's strategy for the postponement of raa is proposed, and the
similarities with Prawitz's approach are investigated. In particular, it is
shown that, as for Prawitz, it is possible to use this variant of Seldin's
strategy in order to induce a negative translation from classical to
intuitionistic and minimal logic, which is nothing but a variant of Kuroda's
translation. Through this translation, Glivenko's theorem for intuitionistic
and minimal logic is proven.
"
21453,Inference for the cross-covariance operator of stationary functional time series,"  When considering two or more time series of functions or curves, for instance
those derived from densely observed intraday stock price data of several
companies, the empirical cross-covariance operator is of fundamental importance
due to its role in functional lagged regression and exploratory data analysis.
Despite its relevance, statistical procedures for measuring the significance of
such estimators are undeveloped. We present methodology based on a functional
central limit theorem for conducting statistical inference for the
cross-covariance operator estimated between two stationary, weakly dependent,
functional time series. Specifically, we consider testing the null hypothesis
that two series possess a specified cross-covariance structure at a given lag.
Since this test assumes that the series are jointly stationary, we also develop
a change-point detection procedure to validate this assumption, which is of
independent interest. The most imposing technical hurdle in implementing the
proposed tests involves estimating the spectrum of a high dimensional spectral
density operator at frequency zero. We propose a simple dimension reduction
procedure based on functional PCA to achieve this, which is shown to perform
well in a small simulation study. We illustrate the proposed methodology with
an application to densely observed intraday price data of stocks listed on the
NYSE.
"
21454,Systematic Testing of Convolutional Neural Networks for Autonomous Driving,"  We present a framework to systematically analyze convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) used in classification of cars in autonomous vehicles. Our
analysis procedure comprises an image generator that produces synthetic
pictures by sampling in a lower dimension image modification subspace and a
suite of visualization tools. The image generator produces images which can be
used to test the CNN and hence expose its vulnerabilities. The presented
framework can be used to extract insights of the CNN classifier, compare across
classification models, or generate training and validation datasets.
"
21455,Sufficient conditions for convergence of multiple Fourier series with $J_k$-lacunary sequence of rectangular partial sums in terms of Weyl multipliers,"  We obtain sufficient conditions for convergence (almost everywhere) of
multiple trigonometric Fourier series of functions $f$ in $L_2$ in terms of
Weyl multipliers. We consider the case where rectangular partial sums of
Fourier series $S_n(x;f)$ have indices $n=(n_1,\dots,n_N) \in \mathbb Z^N$,
$N\ge 3$, in which $k$ $(1\leq k\leq N-2)$ components on the places
$\{j_1,\dots,j_k\}=J_k \subset \{1,\dots,N\} = M$ are elements of (single)
lacunary sequences (i.e., we consider the, so called, multiple Fourier series
with $J_k$-lacunary sequence of partial sums). We prove that for any sample
$J_k\subset M$ the Weyl multiplier for convergence of these series has the form
$W(\nu)=\prod \limits_{j=1}^{N-k} \log(|\nu_{{\alpha}_j}|+2)$, where
$\alpha_j\in M\setminus J_k $, $\nu=(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N)\in{\mathbb Z}^N$. So,
the ""one-dimensional"" Weyl multiplier -- $\log(|\cdot|+2)$ -- presents in
$W(\nu)$ only on the places of ""free"" (nonlacunary) components of the vector
$\nu$. Earlier, in the case where $N-1$ components of the index $n$ are
elements of lacunary sequences, convergence almost everywhere for multiple
Fourier series was obtained in 1977 by M.Kojima in the classes $L_p$, $p>1$,
and by D.K.Sanadze, Sh.V.Kheladze in Orlizc class. Note, that presence of two
or more ""free"" components in the index $n$ (as follows from the results by
Ch.Fefferman (1971)) does not guarantee the convergence almost everywhere of
$S_n(x;f)$ for $N\geq 3$ even in the class of continuous functions.
"
21456,"Emergent phases in iron pnictides: Double-Q antiferromagnetism, charge order and enhanced nematic correlations","  Electron correlations produce a rich phase diagram in the iron pnictides.
Earlier theoretical studies on the correlation effect demonstrated how quantum
fluctuations weaken and concurrently suppress a $C_2$-symmetric single-Q
antiferromagnetic order and a nematic order. Here we examine the emergent
phases near the quantum phase transition. For a $C_4$-symmetric collinear
double-Q antiferromagnetic order, we show that it is accompanied by both a
charge order and an enhanced nematic susceptibility. Our results provide
understanding for several intriguing recent experiments in hole-doped iron
arsenides, and bring out common physics that underlies the different magnetic
phases of various iron-based superconductors.
"
21457,Synergistic effects in threshold models on networks,"  Network structure can have significant effects on the propagation of
diseases, memes, and information on social networks. Such effects depend on the
specific type of dynamical process that affects the nodes and edges of a
network, and it is important to develop tractable models of spreading processes
on networks to explore how network structure affects dynamics. In this paper,
we incorporate the idea of \emph{synergy} into a two-state (""active"" or
""passive"") threshold model of social influence on networks. Our model's update
rule is deterministic, and the influence of each meme-carrying (i.e., active)
neighbor can --- depending on a parameter --- either be enhanced or inhibited
by an amount that depends on the number of active neighbors of a node. Such a
synergistic system models social behavior in which the willingness to adopt
either accelerates or saturates depending on the number of neighbors who have
adopted that behavior. We illustrate that the synergy parameter in our model
has a crucial effect on system dynamics, as it determines whether degree-$k$
nodes are possible or impossible to activate. We simulate synergistic meme
spreading on both random-graph models and networks constructed from empirical
data. Using a local-tree approximation, we examine the spreading of synergistic
memes and find good agreement on all but one of the networks on which we
simulate spreading. We find for any network and for a broad family of
synergistic models that one can predict which synergy-parameter values allow
degree-$k$ nodes to be activated.
"
21458,Bayesian stochastic blockmodeling,"  This chapter provides a self-contained introduction to the use of Bayesian
inference to extract large-scale modular structures from network data, based on
the stochastic blockmodel (SBM), as well as its degree-corrected and
overlapping generalizations. We focus on nonparametric formulations that allow
their inference in a manner that prevents overfitting, and enables model
selection. We discuss aspects of the choice of priors, in particular how to
avoid underfitting via increased Bayesian hierarchies, and we contrast the task
of sampling network partitions from the posterior distribution with finding the
single point estimate that maximizes it, while describing efficient algorithms
to perform either one. We also show how inferring the SBM can be used to
predict missing and spurious links, and shed light on the fundamental
limitations of the detectability of modular structures in networks.
"
21459,Hardy Spaces ($0<p<\infty$) over Lipschitz Domains,"  Let $0<p<\infty$, $\Gamma$ be a Lipschitz curve on the complex
plane~$\mathbb{C}$ and $\Omega_+$ is the domain above $\Gamma$, we define Hardy
space $H^p(\Omega_+)$ as the set of analytic functions $F$ satisfying
$\sup_{\tau>0}(\int_{\Gamma} |F(\zeta+\mathrm{i}\tau)|^p
|\,\mathrm{d}\zeta|)^{\frac1p}< \infty$. We denote the conformal mapping from
$\mathbb{C}_+$ onto $\Omega_+$ as $\Phi$, and prove that, $H^p(\Omega_+)$ is
isomorphic to $H^p(\mathbb{C}_+)$, the classical Hardy space on the upper half
plane~$\mathbb{C}_+$, under the mapping $T\colon F\to F(\Phi)\cdot
(\Phi')^{\frac1p}$. Besides, $T$ and $T^{-1}$ are both bounded. We also prove
that if $F(w)\in H^p(\Omega_+)$, then $F(w)$ has non-tangential boundary limit
$F(\zeta)$ a.e. on $\Gamma$, and, if $1\leqslant p< \infty$, $F(w)$ is the
Cauchy integral on $\Gamma$ of $F(\zeta)$.
"
21460,A Crevice on the Crane Beach: Finite-Degree Predicates,"  First-order logic (FO) over words is shown to be equiexpressive with FO
equipped with a restricted set of numerical predicates, namely the order, a
binary predicate MSB$_0$, and the finite-degree predicates: FO[Arb] = FO[<,
MSB$_0$, Fin].
The Crane Beach Property (CBP), introduced more than a decade ago, is true of
a logic if all the expressible languages admitting a neutral letter are
regular.
Although it is known that FO[Arb] does not have the CBP, it is shown here
that the (strong form of the) CBP holds for both FO[<, Fin] and FO[<, MSB$_0$].
Thus FO[<, Fin] exhibits a form of locality and the CBP, and can still express
a wide variety of languages, while being one simple predicate away from the
expressive power of FO[Arb]. The counting ability of FO[<, Fin] is studied as
an application.
"
21461,Dirichlet's and Thomson's principles for non-selfadjoint elliptic operators with application to non-reversible metastable diffusion processes,"  We present two variational formulae for the capacity in the context of
non-selfadjoint elliptic operators. The minimizers of these variational
problems are expressed as solutions of boundary-value elliptic equations. We
use these principles to provide a sharp estimate for the transition times
between two different wells for non-reversible diffusion processes. This
estimate permits to describe the metastable behavior of the system.
"
21462,Real-space investigation of short-range magnetic correlations in fluoride pyrochlores NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$ and NaSrCo$_2$F$_7$ with magnetic pair distribution function analysis,"  We present time-of-flight neutron total scattering and polarized neutron
scattering measurements of the magnetically frustrated compounds
NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$ and NaSrCo$_2$F$_7$, which belong to a class of recently
discovered pyrochlore compounds based on transition metals and fluorine. The
magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) technique is used to analyze and
model the total scattering data in real space. We find that a
previously-proposed model of short-range XY-like correlations with a length
scale of 10-15 \AA, combined with nearest-neighbor collinear antiferromagnetic
correlations, accurately describes the mPDF data at low temperature, confirming
the magnetic ground state in these materials. This model is further verified by
the polarized neutron scattering data. From an analysis of the temperature
dependence of the mPDF and polarized neutron scattering data, we find that
short-range correlations persist on the nearest-neighbor length scale up to 200
K, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the spin freezing
temperatures of these compounds. These results highlight the opportunity
presented by these new pyrochlore compounds to study the effects of geometric
frustration at relatively high temperatures, while also advancing the mPDF
technique and providing a novel opportunity to investigate a genuinely
short-range-ordered magnetic ground state directly in real space.
"
21463,Embedding is not Cipher: Understanding the risk of embedding leakages,"  Machine Learning (ML) already has been integrated into all kinds of systems,
helping developers to solve problems with even higher accuracy than human
beings. However, when integrating ML models into a system, developers may
accidentally take not enough care of the outputs of ML models, mainly because
of their unfamiliarity with ML and AI, resulting in severe consequences like
hurting data owners' privacy. In this work, we focus on understanding the risks
of abusing embeddings of ML models, an important and popular way of using ML.
To show the consequence, we reveal several kinds of channels in which
embeddings are accidentally leaked. As our study shows, a face verification
system deployed by a government organization leaking only distance to authentic
users allows an attacker to exactly recover the embedding of the verifier's
pre-installed photo. Further, as we discovered, with the leaked embedding,
attackers can easily recover the input photo with negligible quality losses,
indicating devastating consequences to users' privacy. This is achieved with
our devised GAN-like structure model, which showed 93.65% success rate on
popular face embedding model under black box assumption.
"
21464,Anatomy of an online misinformation network,"  Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over
social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite
intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and
fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of
the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main
purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these
questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic
studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter.
Hoaxy filters public tweets that include links to unverified claims or
fact-checking articles. We perform k-core decomposition on a diffusion network
obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand
accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery
to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots
proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around
the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense
connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be
disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first

21465,Injection Bucket Jitter Compensation Using Phase Lock System At Fermilab Booster,"  The extraction bucket position in the Fermilab Booster is controlled with a
cogging process that involves the comparison of the Booster RF count and the
Recycler Ring revolution marker. A one RF bucket jitter in the extraction
bucket position results from the variability of the process that phase matches
the Booster to the Recycler. However, the new slow phase lock process used to
lock the frequency and phase of the Booster RF to the Recycler RF has been made
digital and programmable and has been modified to correct the extraction notch
position. The beam loss at the Recycler injection has been reduced by 20%. Beam
studies and the phase lock system will be discussed in this paper.
"
21466,Collaborative Deep Learning in Fixed Topology Networks,"  There is significant recent interest to parallelize deep learning algorithms
in order to handle the enormous growth in data and model sizes. While most
advances focus on model parallelization and engaging multiple computing agents
via using a central parameter server, aspect of data parallelization along with
decentralized computation has not been explored sufficiently. In this context,
this paper presents a new consensus-based distributed SGD (CDSGD) (and its
momentum variant, CDMSGD) algorithm for collaborative deep learning over fixed
topology networks that enables data parallelization as well as decentralized
computation. Such a framework can be extremely useful for learning agents with
access to only local/private data in a communication constrained environment.
We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm with strongly
convex and nonconvex objective functions with fixed and diminishing step sizes
using concepts of Lyapunov function construction. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our algorithms in comparison with the baseline centralized SGD and the
recently proposed federated averaging algorithm (that also enables data
parallelism) based on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
"
21467,Learning Hidden Markov Models from Pairwise Co-occurrences with Application to Topic Modeling,"  We present a new algorithm for identifying the transition and emission
probabilities of a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the emitted data.
Expectation-maximization becomes computationally prohibitive for long
observation records, which are often required for identification. The new
algorithm is particularly suitable for cases where the available sample size is
large enough to accurately estimate second-order output probabilities, but not
higher-order ones. We show that if one is only able to obtain a reliable
estimate of the pairwise co-occurrence probabilities of the emissions, it is
still possible to uniquely identify the HMM if the emission probability is
\emph{sufficiently scattered}. We apply our method to hidden topic Markov
modeling, and demonstrate that we can learn topics with higher quality if
documents are modeled as observations of HMMs sharing the same emission (topic)
probability, compared to the simple but widely used bag-of-words model.

21468,An explicit formula for Szego kernels on the Heisenberg group,"  In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the Szego kernel for $(0, q)$
forms on the Heisenberg group $H_{n+1}$.
"
21469,Necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent root reconstruction in Markov models on trees,"  We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent root
reconstruction in continuous-time Markov models with countable state space on
bounded-height trees. Here a root state estimator is said to be consistent if
the probability that it returns to the true root state converges to 1 as the
number of leaves tends to infinity. We also derive quantitative bounds on the
error of reconstruction. Our results answer a question of Gascuel and Steel and
have implications for ancestral sequence reconstruction in a classical
evolutionary model of nucleotide insertion and deletion.
"
21470,Perfectly Controllable Multi-Agent Networks,"  This note investigates how to design topology structures to ensure the
controllability of multi-agent networks (MASs) under any selection of leaders.
We put forward a concept of perfect controllability, which means that a
multi-agent system is controllable with no matter how the leaders are chosen.
In this situation, both the number and the locations of leader agents are
arbitrary. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the perfect
controllability. Moreover, a step-by-step design procedure is proposed by which
topologies are constructed and are proved to be perfectly controllable. The
principle of the proposed design method is interpreted by schematic diagrams
along with the corresponding topology structures from simple to complex. We
show that the results are valid for any number and any location of leaders.
Both the construction process and the corresponding topology structures are
clearly outlined.
"
21471,Origin of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies in the Coma Cluster without fine-tuning,"  After thirty years of the discovery of the fundamental plane, explanations to
the tilt of the fundamental plane with respect to the virial plane still suffer
from the need of fine-tuning. In this paper, we try to explore the origin of
this tilt from the perspective of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) by
applying the 16 Coma galaxies available in Thomas et al.[1]. Based on the mass
models that can reproduce de Vaucouleurs' law closely, we find that the tilt of
the traditional fundamental plane is naturally explained by the simple form of
the MONDian interpolating function, if we assume a well motivated choice of
anisotropic velocity distribution, and adopt the Kroupa or Salpeter stellar
mass-to-light ratio. Our analysis does not necessarily rule out a varying
stellar mass-to-light ratio.
"
21472,Dopants Promoting Ferroelectricity in Hafnia: Insights From A Comprehensive Chemical Space Exploration,"  Although dopants have been extensively employed to promote ferroelectricity
in hafnia films, their role in stabilizing the responsible ferroelectric
non-equilibrium Pca21 phase is not well understood. In this work, using first
principles computations, we investigate the influence of nearly 40 dopants on
the phase stability in bulk hafnia to identify dopants that can favor formation
of the polar Pca21 phase. Although no dopant was found to stabilize this polar
phase as the ground state, suggesting that dopants alone cannot induce
ferroelectricity in hafnia, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Y and Gd were found to
significantly lower the energy of the polar phase with respect to the
equilibrium monoclinic phase. These results are consistent with the empirical
measurements of large remnant polarization in hafnia films doped with these
elements. Additionally, clear chemical trends of dopants with larger ionic
radii and lower electronegativity favoring the polar Pca21 phase in hafnia were
identified. For this polar phase, an additional bond between the dopant cation
and the 2nd nearest oxygen neighbor was identified as the root-cause of these
trends. Further, trivalent dopants (Y, La, and Gd) were revealed to stabilize
the polar Pca21 phase at lower strains when compared to divalent dopants (Sr
and Ba). Based on these insights, we predict that the lanthanide series metals,
the lower half of alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr and Ba) and Y as the most
suitable dopants to promote ferroelectricity in hafnia.
"
21473,Wave propagation with irregular dissipation and applications to acoustic problems and shallow waters,"  In this paper we consider an acoustic problem of wave propagation through a
discontinuous medium. The problem is reduced to the dissipative wave equation
with distributional dissipation. We show that this problem has a so-called very
weak solution, we analyse its properties and illustrate the theoretical results
through some numerical simulations by approximating the solutions to the full
dissipative model for a particular synthetic piecewise continuous medium. In
particular, we discover numerically a very interesting phenomenon of the
appearance of a new wave at the singular point. For the acoustic problem this
can be interpreted as an echo effect at the discontinuity interface of the
medium.
"
21474,Superconductivity vs quantum criticality: effects of thermal fluctuations,"  We study the interplay between superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid
behavior of a Fermi surface coupled to a massless $SU(N)$ matrix boson near the
quantum critical point. The presence of thermal infrared singularities in both
the fermionic self-energy and the gap equation invalidates the Eliashberg
approximation, and makes the quantum-critical pairing problem qualitatively
different from that at zero temperature. Taking the large $N$ limit, we solve
the gap equation beyond the Eliashberg approximation, and obtain the
superconducting temperature $T_c$ as a function of $N$. Our results show an
anomalous scaling between the zero-temperature gap and $T_c$. For $N$ greater
than a critical value, we find that $T_c$ vanishes with a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scaling behavior, and the system retains
non-Fermi liquid behavior down to zero temperature. This confirms and extends
previous renormalization-group analyses done at $T=0$, and provides a
controlled example of a naked quantum critical point. We discuss the crucial
role of thermal fluctuations in relating our results with earlier work where
superconductivity always develops due to the special role of the first
Matsubara frequency.
"
21475,Ensemble Framework for Real-time Decision Making,"  This paper introduces a new framework for real-time decision making in video
games. An Ensemble agent is a compound agent composed of multiple agents, each
with its own tasks or goals to achieve. Usually when dealing with real-time
decision making, reactive agents are used; that is agents that return a
decision based on the current state. While reactive agents are very fast, most
games require more than just a rule-based agent to achieve good results.
Deliberative agents---agents that use a forward model to search future
states---are very useful in games with no hard time limit, such as Go or
Backgammon, but generally take too long for real-time games. The Ensemble
framework addresses this issue by allowing the agent to be both deliberative
and reactive at the same time. This is achieved by breaking up the game-play
into logical roles and having highly focused components for each role, with
each component disregarding anything outwith its own role. Reactive agents can
be used where a reactive agent is suited to the role, and where a deliberative
approach is required, branching is kept to a minimum by the removal of all
extraneous factors, enabling an informed decision to be made within a much
smaller time-frame. An Arbiter is used to combine the component results,
allowing high performing agents to be created from simple, efficient
components.
"
21476,Reliability and Market Price of Energy in the Presence of Intermittent and Non-Dispatchable Renewable Energies,"  The intermittent nature of the renewable energies increases the operation
costs of conventional generators. As the share of energy supplied by renewable
sources increases, these costs also increase. In this paper, we quantify these
costs by developing a market clearing price of energy in the presence of
renewable energy and congestion constraints. We consider an electricity market
where generators propose their asking price per unit of energy to an
independent system operator (ISO). The ISO solve an optimization problem to
dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the total cost of energy
purchased on behalf of the consumers.
To ensure that the generators are able to meet the load within a desired
confidence level, we incorporate the notion of load variance using the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVAR) measure in an electricity market and we derive
the amount of committed power and market clearing price of energy as a function
of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration of renewable energies may
increase the committed power, market clearing price of energy and consumer cost
of energy due to renewable generation uncertainties. We also obtain an
upper-bound on the amount that congestion constraints can affect the committed
power. We present descriptive simulations to illustrate the impact of renewable
energy penetration and reliability levels on committed power by the
non-renewable generators, difference between the dispatched and committed
power, market price of energy and profit of renewable and non-renewable
generators.
"
21477,Does Neural Machine Translation Benefit from Larger Context?,"  We propose a neural machine translation architecture that models the
surrounding text in addition to the source sentence. These models lead to
better performance, both in terms of general translation quality and pronoun
prediction, when trained on small corpora, although this improvement largely
disappears when trained with a larger corpus. We also discover that
attention-based neural machine translation is well suited for pronoun
prediction and compares favorably with other approaches that were specifically
designed for this task.
"
21478,Heat asymptotics for nonminimal Laplace type operators and application to noncommutative tori,"  Let $P$ be a Laplace type operator acting on a smooth hermitean vector bundle
$V$ of fiber $\mathbb{C}^N$ over a compact Riemannian manifold given locally by
$P= - [g^{\mu\nu} u(x)\partial_\mu\partial_\nu + v^\nu(x)\partial_\nu + w(x)]$
where $u,\,v^\nu,\,w$ are $M_N(\mathbb{C})$-valued functions with $u(x)$
positive and invertible. For any $a \in \Gamma(\text{End}(V))$, we consider the
asymptotics $\text{Tr} (a e^{-tP}) \underset{t \downarrow 0^+}{\sim}
\,\sum_{r=0}^\infty a_r(a, P)\,t^{(r-d)/2}$ where the coefficients $a_r(a, P)$
can be written locally as $a_r(a, P)(x) = \text{tr}[a(x) \mathcal{R}_r(x)]$.
The computation of $\mathcal{R}_2$ is performed opening the opportunity to
calculate the modular scalar curvature for noncommutative tori.
"
21479,DLVM: A modern compiler infrastructure for deep learning systems,"  Deep learning software demands reliability and performance. However, many of
the existing deep learning frameworks are software libraries that act as an
unsafe DSL in Python and a computation graph interpreter. We present DLVM, a
design and implementation of a compiler infrastructure with a linear algebra
intermediate representation, algorithmic differentiation by adjoint code
generation, domain-specific optimizations and a code generator targeting GPU
via LLVM. Designed as a modern compiler infrastructure inspired by LLVM, DLVM
is more modular and more generic than existing deep learning compiler
frameworks, and supports tensor DSLs with high expressivity. With our
prototypical staged DSL embedded in Swift, we argue that the DLVM system
enables a form of modular, safe and performant frameworks for deep learning.
"
21480,k-Space Deep Learning for Parallel MRI: Application to Time-Resolved MR Angiography,"  Time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories (TWIST)
has been widely used for dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). To achieve
highly accelerated acquisitions, TWIST combines the periphery of the k-space
data from several adjacent frames to reconstruct one temporal frame. However,
this view-sharing scheme limits the true temporal resolution of TWIST.
Moreover, the k-space sampling patterns have been specially designed for a
specific generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA)
factor so that it is not possible to reduce the number of view-sharing once the
k-data is acquired. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
k-space deep learning approach for parallel MRI. In particular, we have
designed our neural network so that accurate k-space interpolations are
performed simultaneously for multiple coils by exploiting the redundancies
along the coils and images. Reconstruction results using in vivo TWIST data set
confirm that the proposed method can immediately generate high-quality
reconstruction results with various choices of view- sharing, allowing us to
exploit the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution in time-resolved
MR angiography.
"
21481,The Effect of Collective Attention on Controversial Debates on Social Media,"  We study the evolution of long-lived controversial debates as manifested on
Twitter from 2011 to 2016. Specifically, we explore how the structure of
interactions and content of discussion varies with the level of collective
attention, as evidenced by the number of users discussing a topic. Spikes in
the volume of users typically correspond to external events that increase the
public attention on the topic -- as, for instance, discussions about `gun
control' often erupt after a mass shooting.
This work is the first to study the dynamic evolution of polarized online
debates at such scale. By employing a wide array of network and content
analysis measures, we find consistent evidence that increased collective
attention is associated with increased network polarization and network
concentration within each side of the debate; and overall more uniform lexicon
usage across all users.
"
21482,Between-Ride Routing for Private Transportation Services,"  Spurred by the growth of transportation network companies and increasing data
capabilities, vehicle routing and ride-matching algorithms can improve the
efficiency of private transportation services. However, existing routing
solutions do not address where drivers should travel after dropping off a
passenger and before receiving the next passenger ride request, i.e., during
the between-ride period. We address this problem by developing an efficient
algorithm to find the optimal policy for drivers between rides in order to
maximize driver profits. We model the road network as a graph, and we show that
the between-ride routing problem is equivalent to a stochastic shortest path
problem, an infinite dynamic program with no discounting. We prove under
reasonable assumptions that an optimal routing policy exists that avoids
cycles; policies of this type can be efficiently found. We present an iterative
approach to find an optimal routing policy. Our approach can account for
various factors, including the frequency of passenger ride requests at
different locations, traffic conditions, and surge pricing. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach by implementing it on road network data from
Boston and New York City.
"
21483,Effective Spoken Language Labeling with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks,"  Understanding spoken language is a highly complex problem, which can be
decomposed into several simpler tasks. In this paper, we focus on Spoken
Language Understanding (SLU), the module of spoken dialog systems responsible
for extracting a semantic interpretation from the user utterance. The task is
treated as a labeling problem. In the past, SLU has been performed with a wide
variety of probabilistic models. The rise of neural networks, in the last
couple of years, has opened new interesting research directions in this domain.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in particular are able not only to represent
several pieces of information as embeddings but also, thanks to their recurrent
architecture, to encode as embeddings relatively long contexts. Such long
contexts are in general out of reach for models previously used for SLU. In
this paper we propose novel RNNs architectures for SLU which outperform
previous ones. Starting from a published idea as base block, we design new deep
RNNs achieving state-of-the-art results on two widely used corpora for SLU:
ATIS (Air Traveling Information System), in English, and MEDIA (Hotel
information and reservation in France), in French.
"
21484,Trust-based Multi-Robot Symbolic Motion Planning with a Human-in-the-Loop,"  Symbolic motion planning for robots is the process of specifying and planning
robot tasks in a discrete space, then carrying them out in a continuous space
in a manner that preserves the discrete-level task specifications. Despite
progress in symbolic motion planning, many challenges remain, including
addressing scalability for multi-robot systems and improving solutions by
incorporating human intelligence. In this paper, distributed symbolic motion
planning for multi-robot systems is developed to address scalability. More
specifically, compositional reasoning approaches are developed to decompose the
global planning problem, and atomic propositions for observation,
communication, and control are proposed to address inter-robot collision
avoidance. To improve solution quality and adaptability, a dynamic,
quantitative, and probabilistic human-to-robot trust model is developed to aid
this decomposition. Furthermore, a trust-based real-time switching framework is
proposed to switch between autonomous and manual motion planning for tradeoffs
between task safety and efficiency. Deadlock- and livelock-free algorithms are
designed to guarantee reachability of goals with a human-in-the-loop. A set of
non-trivial multi-robot simulations with direct human input and trust
evaluation are provided demonstrating the successful implementation of the
trust-based multi-robot symbolic motion planning methods.
"
21485,Investigation of Beam Emittance and Beam Transport Line Optics on Polarization,"  Effects of beam emittance, energy spread, optical parameters and magnet
misalignment on beam polarization through particle transport systems are
investigated. Particular emphasis will be placed on the beam lines being used
at Fermilab for the development of the muon beam for the Muon g-2 experiment,
including comparisons with the natural polarization resulting from pion decay,
and comments on the development of systematic correlations among phase space
variables.
"
21486,Metrics for Bengali Text Entry Research,"  With the intention of bringing uniformity to Bengali text entry research,
here we present a new approach for calculating the most popular English text
entry evaluation metrics for Bengali. To demonstrate our approach, we conducted
a user study where we evaluated four popular Bengali text entry techniques.
"
21487,Annexing magic and tune-out wavelengths to the clock transitions of the alkaline-earth metal ions,"  We present additional magic wavelengths ($\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$) for the
clock transitions in the alkaline-earth metal ions considering circular
polarized light aside from our previously reported values in [J. Kaur et al.,
Phys. Rev. A {\bf 92}, 031402(R) (2015)] for the linearly polarized light.
Contributions from the vector component to the dynamic dipole polarizabilities
($\alpha_d(\omega)$) of the atomic states associated with the clock transitions
play major roles in the evaluation of these $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$, hence
facilitating in choosing circular polarization of lasers in the experiments.
Moreover, the actual clock transitions in these ions are carried out among the
hyperfine levels. The $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$ values in these hyperfine
transitions are estimated and found to be different from $\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$
for the atomic transitions due to different contributions coming from the
vector and tensor part of $\alpha_d(\omega)$. Importantly, we also present
$\lambda_{\rm{magic}}$ values that depend only on the scalar component of
$\alpha_d(\omega)$ for their uses in a specially designed trap geometry for
these ions so that they can be used unambiguously among any hyperfine levels of
the atomic states of the clock transitions. We also present $\alpha_d(\omega)$
values explicitly at the 1064 nm for the atomic states associated with the
clock transitions which may be useful for creating ""high-field seeking"" traps
for the above ions using the Nd:YAG laser. The tune out wavelengths at which
the states would be free from the Stark shifts are also presented. Accurate
values of the electric dipole matrix elements required for these studies are
given and trends of electron correlation effects in determining them are also
highlighted.
"
21488,Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Web-Scale Recommender Systems,"  Recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data have
led to state-of-the-art performance on recommender system benchmarks. However,
making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks
with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains a challenge.
Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and
deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) algorithm PinSage, which combines efficient random walks and graph
convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate
both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN
approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to
structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on
harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of
the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to
generate embeddings using a trained model. We deploy PinSage at Pinterest and
train it on 7.5 billion examples on a graph with 3 billion nodes representing
pins and boards, and 18 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user
studies and A/B tests, PinSage generates higher-quality recommendations than
comparable deep learning and graph-based alternatives. To our knowledge, this
is the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way
for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph
convolutional architectures.
"
21489,Suggestive Annotation: A Deep Active Learning Framework for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"  Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in biomedical image analysis.
Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising results on many
biomedical image segmentation benchmarks. However, due to large variations in
biomedical images (different modalities, image settings, objects, noise, etc),
to utilize deep learning on a new application, it usually needs a new set of
training data. This can incur a great deal of annotation effort and cost,
because only biomedical experts can annotate effectively, and often there are
too many instances in images (e.g., cells) to annotate. In this paper, we aim
to address the following question: With limited effort (e.g., time) for
annotation, what instances should be annotated in order to attain the best
performance? We present a deep active learning framework that combines fully
convolutional network (FCN) and active learning to significantly reduce
annotation effort by making judicious suggestions on the most effective
annotation areas. We utilize uncertainty and similarity information provided by
FCN and formulate a generalized version of the maximum set cover problem to
determine the most representative and uncertain areas for annotation. Extensive
experiments using the 2015 MICCAI Gland Challenge dataset and a lymph node
ultrasound image segmentation dataset show that, using annotation suggestions
by our method, state-of-the-art segmentation performance can be achieved by
using only 50% of training data.
"
21490,Estimation for high-frequency data under parametric market microstructure noise,"  In this paper, we propose a general class of noise-robust estimators based on
the existing estimators in the non-noisy high-frequency data literature. The
market microstructure noise is a known parametric function of the limit order
book. The noise-robust estimators are constructed as a plug-in version of their
counterparts, where we replace the efficient price, which is non-observable in
our framework, by an estimator based on the raw price and the limit order book
data. We show that the technology can be directly applied to estimate
volatility, high-frequency covariance, functionals of volatility and volatility
of volatility in a general nonparametric framework where, depending on the
problem at hand, price possibly includes infinite jump activity and sampling
times encompass asynchronicity and endogeneity.
"
21491,Probably approximate Bayesian computation: nonasymptotic convergence of ABC under misspecification,"  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a widely used inference method in
Bayesian statistics to bypass the point-wise computation of the likelihood. In
this paper we develop theoretical bounds for the distance between the
statistics used in ABC. We show that some versions of ABC are inherently robust
to misspecification. The bounds are given in the form of oracle inequalities
for a finite sample size. The dependence on the dimension of the parameter
space and the number of statistics is made explicit. The results are shown to
be amenable to oracle inequalities in parameter space. We apply our theoretical
results to given prior distributions and data generating processes, including a
non-parametric regression model. In a second part of the paper, we propose a
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the pseudo-posterior, improving
upon the state of the art samplers.
"
21492,Generation of soliton bubbles in a sine-Gordon system with localised inhomogeneities,"  Nonlinear wave propagation plays a crucial role in the functioning of many
physical and biophysical systems. In the propagation regime, disturbances due
to the presence of local external perturbations, such as localised defects or
boundary interphase walls have gained great attention. In this article, the
complex phenomena that occur when sine-Gordon line solitons collide with
localised inhomogeneities are investigated. By a one-dimensional theory, it is
shown that internal modes of two-dimensional sine-Gordon solitons can be
activated depending on the topological properties of the inhomogeneities. Shape
mode instabilities cause the formation of bubble-like and drop-like structures
for both stationary and travelling line solitons. It is shown that such
structures are formed and stabilised by arrays of localised inhomogeneities
distributed in space. Implications of the observed phenomena in physical and
biological systems are discussed.
"
21493,Development and Test of a uTPC Cluster Reconstruction for a Triple GEM Detector in Strong Magnetic Field,"  Performance of triple GEM prototypes has been evaluated by means of a muon
beam at the H4 line of the SPS test area at CERN. The data from two planar
prototypes have been reconstructed and analyzed offline with two clusterization
methods: the enter of gravity of the charge distribution and the micro Time
Projection Chamber (\muTPC). Concerning the spatial resolution, the charge
centroid cluster reconstruction performs extremely well with no magnetic field:
the resolution is well below 100 \mum . Increasing the magnetic field
intensity, the resolution degrades almost linearly as effect of the Lorentz
force that displaces, broadens and asymmetrizes the electron avalanche. Tuning
the electric fields of the GEM prototype we could achieve the unprecedented
spatial resolution of 190 \mum at 1 Tesla. In order to boost the spatial
resolution with strong magnetic field and inclined tracks a \muTPC cluster
reconstruction has been investigated. Such a readout mode exploits the good
time resolution of the GEM detector and electronics to reconstruct the
trajectory of the particle inside the conversion gap. Beside the improvement of
the spatial resolution, information on the track angle can be also extracted.
The new clustering algorithm has been tested with diagonal tracks with no
magnetic field showing a resolution between 100 um and 150 um for the incident
angle ranging from 10° to 45° . Studies show similar performance with
1 Tesla magnetic field. This is the first use of a \muTPC readout with a triple
GEM detector in magnetic field. This study has shown that a combined readout is
capable to guarantee stable performance over a broad spectrum of particle
momenta and incident angles, up to a 1 Tesla magnetic field.

21494,"An update to the EVEREST K2 pipeline: Short cadence, saturated stars, and Kepler-like photometry down to Kp = 15","  We present an update to the EVEREST K2 pipeline that addresses various
limitations in the previous version and improves the photometric precision of
the de-trended light curves. We develop a fast regularization scheme for third
order pixel level decorrelation (PLD) and adapt the algorithm to include the
PLD vectors of neighboring stars to enhance the predictive power of the model
and minimize overfitting, particularly for faint stars. We also modify PLD to
work for saturated stars and improve its performance on extremely variable
stars. On average, EVEREST 2.0 light curves have 10-20% higher photometric
precision than those in the previous version, yielding the highest precision
light curves at all Kp magnitudes of any publicly available K2 catalog. For
most K2 campaigns, we recover the original Kepler precision to at least Kp =
14, and to at least Kp = 15 for campaigns 1, 5, and 6. We also de-trend all
short cadence targets observed by K2, obtaining even higher photometric
precision for these stars. All light curves for campaigns 0-8 are available
online in the EVEREST catalog, which will be continuously updated with future
campaigns. EVEREST 2.0 is open source and is coded in a general framework that
can be applied to other photometric surveys, including Kepler and the upcoming
TESS mission.

21495,Induction of tin pest for cleaning tin-drop contaminated optics,"  Tin pest, the allotropic {\beta} - {\alpha} phase transformation of tin, was
examined for use in cleaning of tin-contaminated optics. Induction of change in
material structure led to disintegration of tin samples into pieces and powder.
The transition times were studied for tin drops of different purity grades,
using inoculation with {\alpha}-Sn seed particles, also after prior mechanical
deformation and surface oxide removal. For tin of very high purity levels fast
nucleation within hours and full transformation within a day could be achieved
during cooling at -24 °C, resulting in strong embrittlement of the
material. Tin dripped onto samples of multilayer-coated optics as used in
extreme ultraviolet lithography machines was made cleanable by phase transition
after inoculation and cooling. The reflectance of multilayer-coated mirrors was
found to decrease by no more than 1% with this cleaning method.
"
21496,Fukaya categories of plumbings and multiplicative preprojective algebras,"  Given an arbitrary graph $\Gamma$ and non-negative integers $g_v$ for each
vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, let $X_\Gamma$ be the Weinstein $4$-manifold obtained
by plumbing copies of $T^*\Sigma_v$ according to this graph, where $\Sigma_v$
is a surface of genus $g_v$. We compute the wrapped Fukaya category of
$X_\Gamma$ (with bulk parameters) using Legendrian surgery extending our
previous work arXiv:1502.07922 where it was assumed that $g_v=0$ for all $v$
and $\Gamma$ was a tree. The resulting algebra is recognized as the (derived)
multiplicative preprojective algebra (and its higher genus version) defined by
Crawley-Boevey and Shaw arXiv:math/0404186. Along the way, we find a smaller
model for the internal DG-algebra of Ekholm-Ng arXiv:1307.8436 associated to
$1$-handles in the Legendrian surgery presentation of Weinstein $4$-manifolds
which might be of independent interest.

development articles published by PLOS Computational Biology.
"
21498,Secure Classification With Augmented Features,"  With the evolution of data collection ways, it is possible to produce
abundant data described by multiple feature sets. Previous studies show that
including more features does not necessarily bring positive effect. How to
prevent the augmented features worsening classification performance is crucial
but rarely studied. In this paper, we study this challenging problem by
proposing a secure classification approach, whose accuracy is never degenerated
when exploiting augmented features. We propose two ways to achieve the security
of our method named as SEcure Classification (SEC). Firstly, to leverage
augmented features, we learn various types of classifiers and adapt them by
employing a specially designed robust loss. It provides various candidate
classifiers to meet the following assumption of security operation. Secondly,
we integrate all candidate classifiers by approximately maximizing the
performance improvement. Under a mild assumption, the integrated classifier has
theoretical security guarantee. Several new optimization methods have been
developed to accommodate the problems with proved convergence. Besides
evaluating SEC on 16 data sets, we also apply SEC in the application of
diagnostic classification of schizophrenia since it has vast application
potentiality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEC in both
tackling security problem and discriminating schizophrenic patients from
healthy controls.

21499,Deceiving Google's Cloud Video Intelligence API Built for Summarizing Videos,"  Despite the rapid progress of the techniques for image classification, video
annotation has remained a challenging task. Automated video annotation would be
a breakthrough technology, enabling users to search within the videos.
Recently, Google introduced the Cloud Video Intelligence API for video
analysis. As per the website, the system can be used to ""separate signal from
noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame""
level. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to
select a video for annotation. The API then detects the video labels (objects
within the video) as well as shot labels (description of the video events over
time). In this paper, we examine the usability of the Google's Cloud Video
Intelligence API in adversarial environments. In particular, we investigate
whether an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that the API
will return only the adversary-desired labels. For this, we select an image,
which is different from the video content, and insert it, periodically and at a
very low rate, into the video. We found that if we insert one image every two
seconds, the API is deceived into annotating the video as if it only contained
the inserted image. Note that the modification to the video is hardly
noticeable as, for instance, for a typical frame rate of 25, we insert only one
image per 50 video frames. We also found that, by inserting one image per
second, all the shot labels returned by the API are related to the inserted
image. We perform the experiments on the sample videos provided by the API
demonstration website and show that our attack is successful with different
videos and images.

21500,Inherent Biases of Recurrent Neural Networks for Phonological Assimilation and Dissimilation,"  A recurrent neural network model of phonological pattern learning is
proposed. The model is a relatively simple neural network with one recurrent
layer, and displays biases in learning that mimic observed biases in human
learning. Single-feature patterns are learned faster than two-feature patterns,
and vowel or consonant-only patterns are learned faster than patterns involving
vowels and consonants, mimicking the results of laboratory learning
experiments. In non-recurrent models, capturing these biases requires the use
of alpha features or some other representation of repeated features, but with a
recurrent neural network, these elaborations are not necessary.
"
21501,A graph-embedded deep feedforward network for disease outcome classification and feature selection using gene expression data,"  Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model
building, because of the small number of samples $(n)$ compared to the huge
amount of features $(p)$. This ""$n<<p$"" property has hampered application of
deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by
incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution
to this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because (1) there are
tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples, (2) the
scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of
convolutional neural networks. To address these issues and build a robust
classification model, we propose the Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks
(GEDFN), to integrate external relational information of features into the deep
neural network architecture. The method is able to achieve sparse connection
between network layers to prevent overfitting. To validate the method's
capability, we conducted both simulation experiments and a real data analysis
using a breast cancer RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The
resulting high classification accuracy and easily interpretable feature
selection results suggest the method is a useful addition to the current
classification models and feature selection procedures. The method is available
at this https URL.

21502,Isometric embeddings of a class of separable metric spaces into Banach spaces,"  Let $(M,d)$ be a bounded countable metric space and $c>0$ a constant, such
that $d(x,y)+d(y,z)-d(x,z) \ge c$, for any pairwise distinct points $x,y,z$ of
$M$. For such metric spaces we prove that they can be isometrically embedded
into any Banach space containing an isomorphic copy of $\ell_\infty$.
"
21503,On stable transitivity of finitely generated groups of volume preserving diffeomorphisms,"  In this paper, we provide a new criterion for the stable transitivity of
volume preserving finite generated group on any compact Riemannian manifold. As
one of our applications, we generalised a result of Dolgopyat and Krikorian in
\cite{DK} and obtained stable transitivity for random rotations on the sphere
in any dimension. As another application, we showed that for $\infty \geq r
\geq 2$, any $C^r$ volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism $g$ on
any compact Riemannian manifold $M$ having sufficiently Hölder stable or
unstable distribution, for any sufficiently large integer $K$, for any
$(f_i)_{i=1}^{K}$ in a $C^1$ open $C^r$ dense subset of
$\textnormal{\Diff}^r(M,m)^K$, the group generated by $g, f_1,\cdots, f_K$ acts
transitively.
"
21504,Cellular Automata on Group Sets,"  We introduce and study cellular automata whose cell spaces are
left-homogeneous spaces. Examples of left-homogeneous spaces are spheres,
Euclidean spaces, as well as hyperbolic spaces acted on by isometries; uniform
tilings acted on by symmetries; vertex-transitive graphs, in particular, Cayley
graphs, acted on by automorphisms; groups acting on themselves by
multiplication; and integer lattices acted on by translations. For such
automata and spaces, we prove, in particular, generalisations of topological
and uniform variants of the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem, of the
Tarski-F{\o}lner theorem, and of the Garden-of-Eden theorem on the full shift
and certain subshifts. Moreover, we introduce signal machines that can handle
accumulations of events and using such machines we present a time-optimal
quasi-solution of the firing mob synchronisation problem on finite and
connected graphs.
"
21505,Scaling from gauge and scalar radiation in Abelian Higgs string networks,"  We investigate cosmic string networks in the Abelian Higgs model using data
from a campaign of large-scale numerical simulations on lattices of up to
$4096^3$ grid points. We observe scaling or self-similarity of the networks
over a wide range of scales, and estimate the asymptotic values of the mean
string separation in horizon length units $\dot{\xi}$ and of the mean square
string velocity $\bar v^2$ in the continuum and large time limits. The scaling
occurs because the strings lose energy into classical radiation of the scalar
and gauge fields of the Abelian Higgs model. We quantify the energy loss with a
dimensionless radiative efficiency parameter, and show that it does not vary
significantly with lattice spacing or string separation. This implies that the
radiative energy loss underlying the scaling behaviour is not a lattice
artefact, and justifies the extrapolation of measured network properties to
large times for computations of cosmological perturbations. We also show that
the core growth method, which increases the defect core width with time to
extend the dynamic range of simulations, does not introduce significant
systematic error. We compare $\dot{\xi}$ and $\bar v^2$ to values measured in
simulations using the Nambu-Goto approximation, finding that the latter
underestimate the mean string separation by about 25%, and overestimate $\bar
v^2$ by about 10%. The scaling of the string separation implies that string
loops decay by the emission of massive radiation within a Hubble time in field
theory simulations, in contrast to the Nambu-Goto scenario which neglects this
energy loss mechanism. String loops surviving for only one Hubble time emit
much less gravitational radiation than in the Nambu-Goto scenario, and are
consequently subject to much weaker gravitational wave constraints on their
tension.
"
21506,An Almost Analytical Approach to Simulating 2D Electronic Spectra,"  We introduce an almost analytical method to simulate 2D electronic spectra as
a double Fourier transform of the the non-linear response function (NRF)
corresponding to a particular optical pulse sequence. We employ a unitary
transformation to represent the total system Hamiltonian in a stationary basis
that allows us to separate contributions from decoherence and phonon-mediated
population relaxation to the NRF. Previously, one of us demonstrated the use of
an analytic, cumulant expansion approach to calculate the decoherence term.
Here, we extend this idea to obtain an accurate expression for the population
relaxation term, a significant improvement over standard quantum master
equation-based approximations. We numerically demonstrate the accuracy of our
method by computing the photon echo spectrum of a two-level system coupled to a
thermal bath, and we highlight the mechanistic insights obtained from our
simulation.
"
21507,"Binary classification models with ""Uncertain"" predictions","  Binary classification models which can assign probabilities to categories
such as ""the tissue is 75% likely to be tumorous"" or ""the chemical is 25%
likely to be toxic"" are well understood statistically, but their utility as an
input to decision making is less well explored. We argue that users need to
know which is the most probable outcome, how likely that is to be true and, in
addition, whether the model is capable enough to provide an answer. It is the
last case, where the potential outcomes of the model explicitly include ""don't
know"" that is addressed in this paper. Including this outcome would better
separate those predictions that can lead directly to a decision from those
where more data is needed. Where models produce an ""Uncertain"" answer similar
to a human reply of ""don't know"" or ""50:50"" in the examples we refer to
earlier, this would translate to actions such as ""operate on tumour"" or ""remove
compound from use"" where the models give a ""more true than not"" answer. Where
the models judge the result ""Uncertain"" the practical decision might be ""carry
out more detailed laboratory testing of compound"" or ""commission new tissue
analyses"". The paper presents several examples where we first analyse the
effect of its introduction, then present a methodology for separating
""Uncertain"" from binary predictions and finally, we provide arguments for its
use in practice.
"
21508,SafePredict: A Meta-Algorithm for Machine Learning That Uses Refusals to Guarantee Correctness,"  SafePredict is a novel meta-algorithm that works with any base prediction
algorithm for online data to guarantee an arbitrarily chosen correctness rate,
$1-\epsilon$, by allowing refusals. Allowing refusals means that the
meta-algorithm may refuse to emit a prediction produced by the base algorithm
on occasion so that the error rate on non-refused predictions does not exceed
$\epsilon$. The SafePredict error bound does not rely on any assumptions on the
data distribution or the base predictor. When the base predictor happens not to
exceed the target error rate $\epsilon$, SafePredict refuses only a finite
number of times. When the error rate of the base predictor changes through time
SafePredict makes use of a weight-shifting heuristic that adapts to these
changes without knowing when the changes occur yet still maintains the
correctness guarantee. Empirical results show that (i) SafePredict compares
favorably with state-of-the art confidence based refusal mechanisms which fail
to offer robust error guarantees; and (ii) combining SafePredict with such
refusal mechanisms can in many cases further reduce the number of refusals. Our
software (currently in Python) is included in the supplementary material.
"
21509,Automated Crowdturfing Attacks and Defenses in Online Review Systems,"  Malicious crowdsourcing forums are gaining traction as sources of spreading
misinformation online, but are limited by the costs of hiring and managing
human workers. In this paper, we identify a new class of attacks that leverage
deep learning language models (Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs) to automate
the generation of fake online reviews for products and services. Not only are
these attacks cheap and therefore more scalable, but they can control rate of
content output to eliminate the signature burstiness that makes crowdsourced
campaigns easy to detect.
Using Yelp reviews as an example platform, we show how a two phased review
generation and customization attack can produce reviews that are
indistinguishable by state-of-the-art statistical detectors. We conduct a
survey-based user study to show these reviews not only evade human detection,
but also score high on ""usefulness"" metrics by users. Finally, we develop novel
automated defenses against these attacks, by leveraging the lossy
transformation introduced by the RNN training and generation cycle. We consider
countermeasures against our mechanisms, show that they produce unattractive
cost-benefit tradeoffs for attackers, and that they can be further curtailed by
simple constraints imposed by online service providers.
"
21510,Manipulating charge-density-wave in monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$ by strain and charge doping: A first-principles investigation,"  We investigate the effects of the in-plane biaxial strain and charge doping
on the charge density wave (CDW) order of monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$ by using the
first-principles calculations. Our results show that the tensile strain can
significantly enhance the CDW order, while both compressive strain and charge
doping (electrons and holes) suppress the CDW instability. The tensile strain
may provide an effective method for obtaining higher CDW transition temperature
on the basis of monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$. We also discuss the potential
superconductivity in charge-doped monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$. Controllable
electronic phase transition from CDW state to metallic state or even
superconducting state can be realized in monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$, which makes
$1T$-TiSe$_2$ possess a promising application in controllable switching
electronic devices based on CDW.
"
21511,Automatic Program Synthesis of Long Programs with a Learned Garbage Collector,"  We consider the problem of generating automatic code given sample
input-output pairs. We train a neural network to map from the current state and
the outputs to the program's next statement. The neural network optimizes
multiple tasks concurrently: the next operation out of a set of high level
commands, the operands of the next statement, and which variables can be
dropped from memory. Using our method we are able to create programs that are
more than twice as long as existing state-of-the-art solutions, while improving
the success rate for comparable lengths, and cutting the run-time by two orders
of magnitude. Our code, including an implementation of various literature
baselines, is publicly available at this https URL
"
21512,ExoMol molecular line lists - XXIII: spectra of PO and PS,"  Comprehensive line lists for phosphorus monoxide ($^{31}$P$^{16}$O) and
phosphorus monosulphide ($^{31}$P$^{32}$S) in their $X$ $^2\Pi$ electronic
ground state are presented. The line lists are based on new ab initio potential
energy (PEC), spin-orbit (SOC) and dipole moment (DMC) curves computed using
the MRCI+Q-r method with aug-cc-pwCV5Z and aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets. The nuclear
motion equations (i.e. the rovibronic Schrödinger equations for each
molecule) are solved using the program Duo. The PECs and SOCs are refined in
least-squares fits to available experimental data. Partition functions, $Q(T)$,
are computed up to $T=$ 5000 K, the range of validity of the line lists. These
line lists are the most comprehensive available for either molecule. The
characteristically sharp peak of the $Q$-branches from the spin-orbit split
components give useful diagnostics for both PO and PS in spectra at infrared
wavelengths. These line lists should prove useful for analysing observations
and setting up models of environments such as brown dwarfs, low-mass stars,
O-rich circumstellar regions and potentially for exoplanetary retrievals. Since
PS is yet to be detected in space, the role of the two lowest excited
electronic states ($a$ $^4\Pi$ and $B$ $^2\Pi$) are also considered. An
approximate line list for the PS $X - B$ electronic transition, which predicts
a number of sharp vibrational bands in the near ultraviolet, is also presented.
he line lists are available from the CDS (cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr) and ExoMol
(www.exomol.com) databases.
"
21513,Statistical Anomaly Detection via Composite Hypothesis Testing for Markov Models,"  Under Markovian assumptions, we leverage a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for
the empirical measure in the test statistic of the composite hypothesis
Hoeffding test so as to establish weak convergence results for the test
statistic, and, thereby, derive a new estimator for the threshold needed by the
test. We first show the advantages of our estimator over an existing estimator
by conducting extensive numerical experiments. We find that our estimator
controls better for false alarms while maintaining satisfactory detection
probabilities. We then apply the Hoeffding test with our threshold estimator to
detecting anomalies in two distinct applications domains: one in communication
networks and the other in transportation networks. The former application seeks
to enhance cyber security and the latter aims at building smarter
transportation systems in cities.
"
21514,A Convex Similarity Index for Sparse Recovery of Missing Image Samples,"  This paper investigates the problem of recovering missing samples using
methods based on sparse representation adapted especially for image signals.
Instead of $l_2$-norm or Mean Square Error (MSE), a new perceptual quality
measure is used as the similarity criterion between the original and the
reconstructed images. The proposed criterion called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM)
index is a modified version of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, which
despite its predecessor, is convex and uni-modal. We derive mathematical
properties for the proposed index and show how to optimally choose the
parameters of the proposed criterion, investigating the Restricted Isometry
(RIP) and error-sensitivity properties. We also propose an iterative sparse
recovery method based on a constrained $l_1$-norm minimization problem,
incorporating CSIM as the fidelity criterion. The resulting convex optimization
problem is solved via an algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). Taking advantage of the convexity of the CSIM index, we
also prove the convergence of the algorithm to the globally optimal solution of
the proposed optimization problem, starting from any arbitrary point.
Simulation results confirm the performance of the new similarity index as well
as the proposed algorithm for missing sample recovery of image patch signals.
"
21515,Image Subtraction Reduction of Open Clusters M35 & NGC 2158 In The K2 Campaign-0 Super-Stamp,"  Observations were made of the open clusters M35 and NGC 2158 during the
initial K2 campaign (C0). Reducing these data to high-precision photometric
time-series is challenging due to the wide point spread function (PSF) and the
blending of stellar light in such dense regions. We developed an
image-subtraction-based K2 reduction pipeline that is applicable to both
crowded and sparse stellar fields. We applied our pipeline to the data-rich C0
K2 super-stamp, containing the two open clusters, as well as to the neighboring
postage stamps. In this paper, we present our image subtraction reduction
pipeline and demonstrate that this technique achieves ultra-high photometric
precision for sources in the C0 super-stamp. We extract the raw light curves of
3960 stars taken from the UCAC4 and EPIC catalogs and de-trend them for
systematic effects. We compare our photometric results with the prior
reductions published in the literature. For detrended, TFA-corrected sources in
the 12--12.25 $\rm K_{p}$ magnitude range, we achieve a best 6.5 hour window
running rms of 35 ppm falling to 100 ppm for fainter stars in the 14--14.25 $
\rm K_{p}$ magnitude range. For stars with $\rm K_{p}> 14$, our detrended and
6.5 hour binned light curves achieve the highest photometric precision.
Moreover, all our TFA-corrected sources have higher precision on all time
scales investigated. This work represents the first published image subtraction
analysis of a K2 super-stamp. This method will be particularly useful for
analyzing the Galactic bulge observations carried out during K2 campaign 9. The
raw light curves and the final results of our detrending processes are publicly
available at \url{this http URL}.
"
21516,Fast random field generation with $H$-matrices,"  We use the $H$-matrix technology to compute the approximate square root of a
covariance matrix in linear cost. This allows us to generate normal and
log-normal random fields on general point sets with optimal cost. We derive
rigorous error estimates which show convergence of the method. Our approach
requires only mild assumptions on the covariance function and on the point set.
Therefore, it might be also a nice alternative to the circulant embedding
approach which applies only to regular grids and stationary covariance
functions.
"
21517,Random Feature Stein Discrepancies,"  Computable Stein discrepancies have been deployed for a variety of
applications, ranging from sampler selection in posterior inference to
approximate Bayesian inference to goodness-of-fit testing. Existing
convergence-determining Stein discrepancies admit strong theoretical guarantees
but suffer from a computational cost that grows quadratically in the sample
size. While linear-time Stein discrepancies have been proposed for
goodness-of-fit testing, they exhibit avoidable degradations in testing
power---even when power is explicitly optimized. To address these shortcomings,
we introduce feature Stein discrepancies ($\Phi$SDs), a new family of quality
measures that can be cheaply approximated using importance sampling. We show
how to construct $\Phi$SDs that provably determine the convergence of a sample
to its target and develop high-accuracy approximations---random $\Phi$SDs
(R$\Phi$SDs)---which are computable in near-linear time. In our experiments
with sampler selection for approximate posterior inference and goodness-of-fit
testing, R$\Phi$SDs perform as well or better than quadratic-time KSDs while
being orders of magnitude faster to compute.
"
21518,3x3 Singular Matrices of Linear Forms,"  We determine the irreducible components of the space of 3x3 matrices of
linear forms with vanishing determinant. We show that there are four
irreducible components and we identify them concretely. In particular, under
elementary row and column operations with constant coefficients, a 3x3 matrix
with vanishing determinant is equivalent to one of the following four: a matrix
with a zero row, a zero column, a zero 2x2 square or an antisymmetric matrix.
"
21519,Continual Learning in Generative Adversarial Nets,"  Developments in deep generative models have allowed for tractable learning of
high-dimensional data distributions. While the employed learning procedures
typically assume that training data is drawn i.i.d. from the distribution of
interest, it may be desirable to model distinct distributions which are
observed sequentially, such as when different classes are encountered over
time. Although conditional variations of deep generative models permit multiple
distributions to be modeled by a single network in a disentangled fashion, they
are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when the distributions are
encountered sequentially. In this paper, we adapt recent work in reducing
catastrophic forgetting to the task of training generative adversarial networks
on a sequence of distinct distributions, enabling continual generative
modeling.
"
21520,Intrinsic Phase Diagram of Superconductivity in the BiCh2-based System Without In-plane Disorder,"  We have investigated the crystal structure and physical properties of
LaO1-xFxBiSSe to reveal the intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the
BiCh2-based layered compound family. From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and
Rietveld refinements with anisotropic displacement parameters, we clearly found
that the in-plane disorder in the BiSSe layer was fully suppressed for all x.
In LaO1-xFxBiSSe, metallic conductivity and superconductivity are suddenly
induced by electron doping even at x = 0.05 and 0.1 with a monoclinic
structure. In addition, x (F concentration) dependence of the transition
temperature (Tc) for x = 0.2-0.5 with a tetragonal structure shows an
anomalously flat phase diagram. With these experimental facts, we have proposed
the intrinsic phase diagram of the ideal BiCh2-based superconductors with less
in-plane disorder.
"
21521,Growth dynamics of turbulent spots in plane Couette flow,"  We experimentally and numerically investigate the temporal aspects of
turbulent spots spreading in a plane Couette flow for transitional Reynolds
numbers between 300 and 450. Spot growth rate, spot advection rate and
large-scale flow intensity are measured as a function of time and Reynolds
number. All these quantities show similar dynamics clarifying the role played
by large-scale flows in the advection of the turbulent spot. The contributions
of each possible growth mechanism: growth induced by large scale advection or
growth by destabilization, are discussed for the different stages of the spot
growth. A scenario which gathers all these elements is providing a better
understanding of the growth dynamics of turbulent spots in plane Couette flow
that should possibly apply to other extended shear flows.
"
21522,On the Distribution of Massive White Dwarfs and its Implication for Accretion-Induced Collapse,"  A White Dwarf (WD) star and a main-sequence companion may interact through
their different stellar evolution stages. This sort of binary population has
historically helped us improve our understanding of binary formation and
evolution scenarios. The data set used for the analysis consists of 115
well-measured WD masses obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). A
substantial fraction of these systems could potentially evolve and reach the
Chandrasekhar limit, and then undergo an Accretion-Induced Collapse (AIC) to
produce millisecond pulsars (MSPs). I focus my attention mainly on the massive
WDs (M_WD > 1M_sun), that are able to grow further by mass-transfer phase in
stellar binary systems to reach the Chandrasekhar mass. A mean value of M ~
1.15 +/- 0.2M_sun is being derived. In the framework of the AIC process, such
systems are considered to be good candidates for the production of MSPs. The
implications of the results presented here to our understanding of binary MSPs
evolution are discussed. As a by-product of my work, I present an updated
distribution of all known pulsars in Galactic coordinates pattern. Keywords:
Stars; Neutron stars; White dwarfs; X-ray binaries; Fundamental parameters.
"
21523,DeepBreath: Deep Learning of Breathing Patterns for Automatic Stress Recognition using Low-Cost Thermal Imaging in Unconstrained Settings,"  We propose DeepBreath, a deep learning model which automatically recognises
people's psychological stress level (mental overload) from their breathing
patterns. Using a low cost thermal camera, we track a person's breathing
patterns as temperature changes around his/her nostril. The paper's technical
contribution is threefold. First of all, instead of creating hand-crafted
features to capture aspects of the breathing patterns, we transform the
uni-dimensional breathing signals into two dimensional respiration variability
spectrogram (RVS) sequences. The spectrograms easily capture the complexity of
the breathing dynamics. Second, a spatial pattern analysis based on a deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is directly applied to the spectrogram
sequences without the need of hand-crafting features. Finally, a data
augmentation technique, inspired from solutions for over-fitting problems in
deep learning, is applied to allow the CNN to learn with a small-scale dataset
from short-term measurements (e.g., up to a few hours). The model is trained
and tested with data collected from people exposed to two types of cognitive
tasks (Stroop Colour Word Test, Mental Computation test) with sessions of
different difficulty levels. Using normalised self-report as ground truth, the
CNN reaches 84.59% accuracy in discriminating between two levels of stress and
56.52% in discriminating between three levels. In addition, the CNN
outperformed powerful shallow learning methods based on a single layer neural
network. Finally, the dataset of labelled thermal images will be open to the
community.
"
21524,Hamiltonian and Algebraic Theories of Gapped Boundaries in Topological Phases of Matter,"  We present an exactly solvable lattice Hamiltonian to realize gapped
boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models for Dijkgraaf-Witten theories. We
classify the elementary excitations on the boundary, and systematically
describe the bulk-to-boundary condensation procedure. We also present the
parallel algebraic/categorical structure of gapped boundaries.
"
21525,Third-harmonic-generation of a diode laser for quantum control of beryllium ions,"  We generate coherent ultraviolet radiation at 313 nm as the third harmonic of
an external-cavity diode laser. We use this radiation for laser cooling of
trapped beryllium atomic ions and sympathetic cooling of co-trapped
beryllium-hydride molecular ions. An LBO crystal in an enhancement cavity
generates the second harmonic, and a BBO crystal in a doubly resonant
enhancement cavity mixes this second harmonic with the fundamental to produce
the third harmonic. Each enhancement cavity is preceded by a tapered amplifier
to increase the fundamental light. The 36-mW output power of this
all-semiconductor-gain system will enable quantum control of the beryllium
ions' motion.
"
21526,Experimental Demonstration of the Sign Reversal of the Order Parameter in (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-yZnySe,"  Iron pnictides are the only known family of unconventional high-temperature
superconductors besides cuprates. Until recently, it was widely accepted that
superconductivity is spin-fluctuation driven and intimately related to their
fermiology, specifically, hole and electron pockets separated by the same wave
vector that characterizes the dominant spin fluctuations, and supporting order
parameters (OP) of opposite signs. This picture was questioned after the
discovery of a new family, based on the FeSe layers, either intercalated or in
the monolayer form. The critical temperatures there reach ~40 K, the same as in
optimally doped bulk FeSe - despite the fact that intercalation removes the
hole pockets from the Fermi level and, seemingly, undermines the basis for the
spin-fluctuation theory and the idea of a sign-changing OP. In this paper,
using the recently proposed phase-sensitive quasiparticle interference
technique, we show that in LiOH intercalated FeSe compound the OP does change
sign, albeit within the electronic pockets, and not between the hole and
electron ones. This result unifies the pairing mechanism of iron based
superconductors with or without the hole Fermi pockets and supports the
conclusion that spin fluctuations play the key role in electron pairing.
"
21527,Defending against Intrusion of Malicious UAVs with Networked UAV Defense Swarms,"  Nowadays, companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and even pizza chains are
pushing forward to use drones, also called UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), for
service provision, such as package and food delivery. As governments intend to
use these immense economic benefits that UAVs have to offer, urban planners are
moving forward to incorporate so-called UAV flight zones and UAV highways in
their smart city designs. However, the high-speed mobility and behavior
dynamics of UAVs need to be monitored to detect and, subsequently, to deal with
intruders, rogue drones, and UAVs with a malicious intent. This paper proposes
a UAV defense system for the purpose of intercepting and escorting a malicious
UAV outside the flight zone. The proposed UAV defense system consists of a
defense UAV swarm, which is capable to self-organize its defense formation in
the event of intruder detection, and chase the malicious UAV as a networked
swarm. Modular design principles have been used for our fully localized
approach. We developed an innovative auto-balanced clustering process to
realize the intercept- and capture-formation. As it turned out, the resulting
networked defense UAV swarm is resilient against communication losses. Finally,
a prototype UAV simulator has been implemented. Through extensive simulations,
we show the feasibility and performance of our approach.
"
21528,Core filling and snaking instability of dark solitons in spin-imbalanced superfluid Fermi gases,"  We use the time-dependent Bogoliubov de Gennes equations to study dark
solitons in three-dimensional spin-imbalanced superfluid Fermi gases. We
explore how the shape and dynamics of dark solitons are altered by the presence
of excess unpaired spins which fill their low-density core. The unpaired
particles broaden the solitons and suppress the transverse snake instability.
We discuss ways of observing these phenomena in cold atom experiments.
"
21529,Gaia-ESO Survey: global properties of clusters Trumpler 14 and 16 in the Carina Nebula,"  We present the first extensive spectroscopic study of the global population
in star clusters Trumpler~16, Trumpler~14 and Collinder~232 in the Carina
Nebula, using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey, down to solar-mass stars. In
addition to the standard homogeneous Survey data reduction, a special
processing was applied here because of the bright nebulosity surrounding Carina
stars. We find about four hundred good candidate members ranging from OB types
down to slightly sub-solar masses. About one-hundred heavily-reddened
early-type Carina members found here were previously unrecognized or poorly
classified, including two candidate O stars and several candidate Herbig Ae/Be
stars. Their large brightness makes them useful tracers of the obscured Carina
population. The spectroscopically-derived temperatures for nearly 300 low-mass
members allows the inference of individual extinction values, and the study of
the relative placement of stars along the line of sight. We find a complex
spatial structure, with definite clustering of low-mass members around the most
massive stars, and spatially-variable extinction. By combining the new data
with existing X-ray data we obtain a more complete picture of the
three-dimensional spatial structure of the Carina clusters, and of their
connection to bright and dark nebulosity, and UV sources. The identification of
tens of background giants enables us also to determine the total optical depth
of the Carina nebula along many sightlines. We are also able to put constraints
on the star-formation history of the region, with Trumpler~14 stars found to be
systematically younger than stars in other sub-clusters. We find a large
percentage of fast-rotating stars among Carina solar-mass members, which
provide new constraints on the rotational evolution of pre-main-sequence stars
in this mass range.
"
21530,Stochastic Deep Learning in Memristive Networks,"  We study the performance of stochastically trained deep neural networks
(DNNs) whose synaptic weights are implemented using emerging memristive devices
that exhibit limited dynamic range, resolution, and variability in their
programming characteristics. We show that a key device parameter to optimize
the learning efficiency of DNNs is the variability in its programming
characteristics. DNNs with such memristive synapses, even with dynamic range as
low as $15$ and only $32$ discrete levels, when trained based on stochastic
updates suffer less than $3\%$ loss in accuracy compared to floating point
software baseline. We also study the performance of stochastic memristive DNNs
when used as inference engines with noise corrupted data and find that if the
device variability can be minimized, the relative degradation in performance
for the Stochastic DNN is better than that of the software baseline. Hence, our
study presents a new optimization corner for memristive devices for building
large noise-immune deep learning systems.
"
21531,Stepwise regression for unsupervised learning,"  I consider unsupervised extensions of the fast stepwise linear regression
algorithm \cite{efroymson1960multiple}. These extensions allow one to
efficiently identify highly-representative feature variable subsets within a
given set of jointly distributed variables. This in turn allows for the
efficient dimensional reduction of large data sets via the removal of redundant
features. Fast search is effected here through the avoidance of repeat
computations across trial fits, allowing for a full representative-importance
ranking of a set of feature variables to be carried out in $O(n^2 m)$ time,
where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of data samples
available. This runtime complexity matches that needed to carry out a single
regression and is $O(n^2)$ faster than that of naive implementations. I present
pseudocode suitable for efficient forward, reverse, and forward-reverse
unsupervised feature selection. To illustrate the algorithm's application, I
apply it to the problem of identifying representative stocks within a given
financial market index -- a challenge relevant to the design of Exchange Traded
Funds (ETFs). I also characterize the growth of numerical error with iteration
step in these algorithms, and finally demonstrate and rationalize the
observation that the forward and reverse algorithms return exactly inverted
feature orderings in the weakly-correlated feature set regime.
"
21532,Stochastic equivalence for performance analysis of concurrent systems in dtsiPBC,"  We propose an extension with immediate multiactions of discrete time
stochastic Petri Box Calculus (dtsPBC), presented by I.V. Tarasyuk. The
resulting algebra dtsiPBC is a discrete time analogue of stochastic Petri Box
Calculus (sPBC) with immediate multiactions, designed by H. Macià, V. Valero
et al. within a continuous time domain. The step operational semantics is
constructed via labeled probabilistic transition systems. The denotational
semantics is based on labeled discrete time stochastic Petri nets with
immediate transitions. To evaluate performance, the corresponding semi-Markov
chains are analyzed. We define step stochastic bisimulation equivalence of
expressions that is applied to reduce their transition systems and underlying
semi-Markov chains while preserving the functionality and performance
characteristics. We explain how this equivalence can be used to simplify
performance analysis of the algebraic processes. In a case study, a method of
modeling, performance evaluation and behaviour reduction for concurrent systems
is outlined and applied to the shared memory system.
"
21533,$O(N)$ Iterative and $O(NlogN)$ Fast Direct Volume Integral Equation Solvers with a Minimal-Rank ${\cal H}^2$-Representation for Large-Scale $3$-D Electrodynamic Analysis,"  Linear complexity iterative and log-linear complexity direct solvers are
developed for the volume integral equation (VIE) based general large-scale
electrodynamic analysis. The dense VIE system matrix is first represented by a
new cluster-based multilevel low-rank representation. In this representation,
all the admissible blocks associated with a single cluster are grouped together
and represented by a single low-rank block, whose rank is minimized based on
prescribed accuracy. From such an initial representation, an efficient
algorithm is developed to generate a minimal-rank ${\cal H}^2$-matrix
representation. This representation facilitates faster computation, and ensures
the same minimal rank's growth rate with electrical size as evaluated from
singular value decomposition. Taking into account the rank's growth with
electrical size, we develop linear-complexity ${\cal H}^2$-matrix-based storage
and matrix-vector multiplication, and thereby an $O(N)$ iterative VIE solver
regardless of electrical size. Moreover, we develop an $O(NlogN)$ matrix
inversion, and hence a fast $O(NlogN)$ \emph{direct} VIE solver for large-scale
electrodynamic analysis. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of
large-scale $1$-, $2$- and $3$-D structures on a single-core CPU, resulting in
millions of unknowns, have demonstrated the low complexity and superior
performance of the proposed VIE electrodynamic solvers. %The algorithms
developed in this work are kernel-independent, and hence applicable to other IE
operators as well.
"
21534,Optimizing Cost-Sensitive SVM for Imbalanced Data :Connecting Cluster to Classification,"  Class imbalance is one of the challenging problems for machine learning in
many real-world applications, such as coal and gas burst accident monitoring:
the burst premonition data is extreme smaller than the normal data, however,
which is the highlight we truly focus on. Cost-sensitive adjustment approach is
a typical algorithm-level method resisting the data set imbalance. For SVMs
classifier, which is modified to incorporate varying penalty parameter(C) for
each of considered groups of examples. However, the C value is determined
empirically, or is calculated according to the evaluation metric, which need to
be computed iteratively and time consuming. This paper presents a novel
cost-sensitive SVM method whose penalty parameter C optimized on the basis of
cluster probability density function(PDF) and the cluster PDF is estimated only
according to similarity matrix and some predefined hyper-parameters.
Experimental results on various standard benchmark data sets and real-world
data with different ratios of imbalance show that the proposed method is
effective in comparison with commonly used cost-sensitive techniques.
"
21535,Plain stopping time and conditional complexities revisited,"  In this paper we analyze the notion of ""stopping time complexity"", informally
defined as the amount of information needed to specify when to stop while
reading an infinite sequence. This notion was introduced by Vovk and Pavlovic
(2016). It turns out that plain stopping time complexity of a binary string $x$
could be equivalently defined as (a) the minimal plain complexity of a Turing
machine that stops after reading $x$ on a one-directional input tape; (b) the
minimal plain complexity of an algorithm that enumerates a prefix-free set
containing $x$; (c)~the conditional complexity $C(x|x*)$ where $x$ in the
condition is understood as a prefix of an infinite binary sequence while the
first $x$ is understood as a terminated binary string; (d) as a minimal upper
semicomputable function $K$ such that each binary sequence has at most $2^n$
prefixes $z$ such that $K(z)<n$; (e) as $\max C^X(x)$ where $C^X(z)$ is plain
Kolmogorov complexity of $z$ relative to oracle $X$ and the maximum is taken
over all extensions $X$ of $x$.
We also show that some of these equivalent definitions become non-equivalent
in the more general setting where the condition $y$ and the object $x$ may
differ. We also answer an open question from Chernov, Hutter and~Schmidhuber.
"
21536,21 Million Opportunities: A 19 Facility Investigation of Factors Affecting Hand Hygiene Compliance via Linear Predictive Models,"  This large-scale study, consisting of 21.3 million hand hygiene opportunities
from 19 distinct facilities in 10 different states, uses linear predictive
models to expose factors that may affect hand hygiene compliance. We examine
the use of features such as temperature, relative humidity, influenza severity,
day/night shift, federal holidays and the presence of new medical residents in
predicting daily hand hygiene compliance; the investigation is undertaken using
both a ""global"" model to glean general trends, and facility-specific models to
elicit facility-specific insights. The results suggest that colder temperatures
and federal holidays have an adverse effect on hand hygiene compliance rates,
and that individual cultures and attitudes regarding hand hygiene exist among
facilities.
"
21537,Conjugacy of one-dimensional one-sided cellular automata is undecidable,"  Two cellular automata are strongly conjugate if there exists a
shift-commuting conjugacy between them. We prove that the following two sets of
pairs $(F,G)$ of one-dimensional one-sided cellular automata over a full shift
are recursively inseparable: (i) pairs where $F$ has strictly larger
topological entropy than $G$, and (ii) pairs that are strongly conjugate and
have zero topological entropy.
Because there is no factor map from a lower entropy system to a higher
entropy one, and there is no embedding of a higher entropy system into a lower
entropy system, we also get as corollaries that the following decision problems
are undecidable: Given two one-dimensional one-sided cellular automata $F$ and
$G$ over a full shift: Are $F$ and $G$ conjugate? Is $F$ a factor of $G$? Is
$F$ a subsystem of $G$? All of these are undecidable in both strong and weak
variants (whether the homomorphism is required to commute with the shift or
not, respectively). It also immediately follows that these results hold for
one-dimensional two-sided cellular automata.
"
21538,On equations over Brandt semigroups,"  In this paper, we study equations over Brandt semigroup $B_n$. We compute
that the number of unsolvable equations in one variable asymptotically equals
$\frac{2}{n^2}$, and the average number of solutions of these equations
asymptotically equals $n^2$.
"
21539,Domains and Event Structures for Fusions,"  Stable event structures, and their duality with prime algebraic domains
(arising as partial orders of configurations), are a landmark of concurrency
theory, providing a clear characterisation of causality in computations. They
have been used for defining a concurrent semantics of several formalisms, from
Petri nets to linear graph rewriting systems, which in turn lay at the basis of
many visual frameworks. Stability however is restrictive for dealing with
formalisms where a computational step can merge parts of the state, like graph
rewriting systems with non-linear rules, which are needed to cover some
relevant applications (such as the graphical encoding of calculi with name
passing). We characterise, as a natural generalisation of prime algebraic
domains, a class of domains that is well-suited to model the semantics of
formalisms with fusions. We then identify a corresponding class of event
structures, that we call connected event structures, via a duality result
formalised as an equivalence of categories. Connected event structures are
exactly the class of event structures the arise as the semantics of non-linear
graph rewriting systems. Interestingly, the category of general unstable event
structures coreflects into our category of domains, so that our result provides
a characterisation of the partial orders of configurations of such event
structures.
"
21540,Beyond Greedy Ranking: Slate Optimization via List-CVAE,"  The conventional approach to solving the recommendation problem is through
greedy ranking by prediction scores for individual document candidates. However
these methods fail to optimize the slate as a whole, and often struggle at
capturing biases caused by the page layout and interdependencies between
documents. The slate recommendation problem aims to find the optimal, ordered
subset of documents, a.k.a. slate, given the page layout to serve users
recommendations. Solving this problem is hard due to combinatorial explosion of
document candidates and their display positions on the page. In this paper, we
introduce List Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (List-CVAE) to learn the
joint distribution of documents on the slate conditional on user responses, and
directly generate slates. Experiments on simulated and real-world data show
that List-CVAE outperforms greedy ranking methods consistently on various
scales of documents corpora.
"
21541,A General Class of Multifractional Processes and Stock Price Informativeness,"  We introduce a general class of stochastic processes driven by a
multifractional Brownian motion (mBm) and study the estimation problems of
their pointwise Hölder exponents (PHE) based on a new localized generalized
quadratic variation approach (LGQV). By comparing our suggested approach with
the other two existing benchmark estimation approaches (classic GQV and
oscillation approach) through a simulation study, we show that our estimator
has better performance in the case where the observed process is some unknown
bivariate function of time and mBm. Such multifractional processes, whose PHEs
are time-varying, can be used to model stock prices under various market
conditions, that are both time-dependent and region-dependent. As an
application to finance, an empirical study on modeling cross-listed stocks
provides new evidence that the equity path's roughness varies via time and the
stock price informativeness properties from global stock markets.
"
21542,Collective Rabi dynamics of electromagnetically-coupled quantum dot ensembles,"  Rabi oscillations typify the inherent nonlinearity of optical excitations in
quantum dots. Using an integral kernel formulation to solve the 3D
Maxwell-Bloch equations in ensembles of up to $10^4$ quantum dots, we observe
features in Rabi oscillations due to the interplay of nonlinearity,
non-equilibrium excitation, and electromagnetic coupling between the dots. This
approach allows us to observe the dynamics of each dot in the ensemble without
resorting to spatial averages. Our simulations predict synchronized multiplets
of dots that exchange energy, dots that dynamically couple to screen the effect
of incident external radiation, localization of the polarization due to
randomness and interactions, as well as wavelength-scale regions of enhanced
and suppressed polarization.
"
21543,Optimality in cellular storage via the Pontryagin Maximum Principle,"  We study an optimal control problem arising from a resource allocation
problem in cellular metabolism. A minimalistic model that describes the
production of enzymatic vs. non-enzymatic biomass components from a single
nutrient source is introduced. The basic growth modes with this model are
linear growth, where only the non-enzymatic component is produced, and
exponential growth with only enzymatic components being produced. Using
Pontryagin's maximum principle, we derive the optimal growth trajectory
depending on the model's parameters. It turns out that depending on the
parameters, either a single growth mode is optimal, or otherwise the optimal
solution is a concatenation of exponential growth with linear growth.
Importantly, on the short time scale, the choice of growth mode depends only on
catalytic rate constants and biomass weights of the two component types,
whereas on longer time scales, where the nutrient amount becomes limiting, also
the yield coefficients play a role.
"
21544,A semidiscrete version of the Citti-Petitot-Sarti model as a plausible model for anthropomorphic image reconstruction and pattern recognition,"  In his beautiful book [66], Jean Petitot proposes a sub-Riemannian model for
the primary visual cortex of mammals. This model is neurophysiologically
justified. Further developments of this theory lead to efficient algorithms for
image reconstruction, based upon the consideration of an associated
hypoelliptic diffusion. The sub-Riemannian model of Petitot and Citti-Sarti (or
certain of its improvements) is a left-invariant structure over the group
$SE(2)$ of rototranslations of the plane. Here, we propose a semi-discrete
version of this theory, leading to a left-invariant structure over the group
$SE(2,N)$, restricting to a finite number of rotations. This apparently very
simple group is in fact quite atypical: it is maximally almost periodic, which
leads to much simpler harmonic analysis compared to $SE(2).$ Based upon this
semi-discrete model, we improve on previous image-reconstruction algorithms and
we develop a pattern-recognition theory that leads also to very efficient
algorithms in practice.
"
21545,Latent Geometry Inspired Graph Dissimilarities Enhance Affinity Propagation Community Detection in Complex Networks,"  Affinity propagation is one of the most effective unsupervised pattern
recognition algorithms for data clustering in high-dimensional feature space.
However, the numerous attempts to test its performance for community detection
in complex networks have been attaining results very far from the state of the
art methods such as Infomap and Louvain. Yet, all these studies agreed that the
crucial problem is to convert the unweighted network topology in a
'smart-enough' node dissimilarity matrix that is able to properly address the
message passing procedure behind affinity propagation clustering. Here we
introduce a conceptual innovation and we discuss how to leverage network latent
geometry notions in order to design dissimilarity matrices for affinity
propagation community detection. Our results demonstrate that the latent
geometry inspired dissimilarity measures we design bring affinity propagation
to equal or outperform current state of the art methods for community
detection. These findings are solidly proven considering both synthetic
'realistic' networks (with known ground-truth communities) and real networks
(with community metadata), even when the data structure is corrupted by noise
artificially induced by missing or spurious connectivity.
"
21546,Free Will in the Theory of Everything,"  From what is known today about the elementary particles of matter, and the
forces that control their behavior, it may be observed that still a host of
obstacles must be overcome that are standing in the way of further progress of
our understanding. Most researchers conclude that drastically new concepts must
be investigated, new starting points are needed, older structures and theories,
in spite of their successes, will have to be overthrown, and new,
superintelligent questions will have to be asked and investigated. In short,
they say that we shall need new physics. Here, we argue in a different manner.
Today, no prototype, or toy model, of any so-called Theory of Everything
exists, because the demands required of such a theory appear to be conflicting.
The demands that we propose include locality, special and general relativity,
together with a fundamental finiteness not only of the forces and amplitudes,
but also of the set of Nature's dynamical variables. We claim that the two
remaining ingredients that we have today, Quantum Field Theory and General
Relativity, indeed are coming a long way towards satisfying such elementary
requirements. Putting everything together in a Grand Synthesis is like solving
a gigantic puzzle. We argue that we need the correct analytical tools to solve
this puzzle. Finally, it seems to be obvious that this solution will give room
neither for ""Divine Intervention"", nor for ""Free Will"", an observation that,
all by itself, can be used as a clue. We claim that this reflects on our
understanding of the deeper logic underlying quantum mechanics.
"
21547,WZ Sge: an eclipsing cataclysmic variable evolving towards the period minimum,"  We present the photometric results of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV)
WZ Sge near the period minimum ($P_{min}$). Eight new mid-eclipse times were
determined and the orbital ephemeris was updated. Our result shows that the
orbital period of WZ Sge is decreasing at a rate of
$\dot{P}=-2.72(\pm0.23)\times{10^{-13}}\,s s^{-1}$. This secular decrease,
coupled with previous detection of its donor, suggest that WZ Sge is a
pre-bounce system. Further analysis indicates that the observed period decrease
rate is about $1.53$ times higher than pure gravitational radiation (GR)
driving. We constructed the evolutionary track of WZ Sge, which predicts that
$P_{min}$ of WZ Sge is $\sim77.98 (\pm0.90)$ min. If the orbital period
decreases at the current rate, WZ Sge will evolve past its $P_{min}$ after
$\sim25.3$ Myr. Based on the period evolution equation we find
$\dot{M}_{2}\simeq4.04(\pm0.10)\times10^{-11}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, which is
compatible with the current concept of CV evolution at ultrashort orbital
periods.
"
21548,Optimizing and Visualizing Deep Learning for Benign/Malignant Classification in Breast Tumors,"  Breast cancer has the highest incidence and second highest mortality rate for
women in the US. Our study aims to utilize deep learning for benign/malignant
classification of mammogram tumors using a subset of cases from the Digital
Database of Screening Mammography (DDSM). Though it was a small dataset from
the view of Deep Learning (about 1000 patients), we show that currently state
of the art architectures of deep learning can find a robust signal, even when
trained from scratch. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we are able
to achieve an accuracy of 85% and an ROC AUC of 0.91, while leading
hand-crafted feature based methods are only able to achieve an accuracy of 71%.
We investigate an amalgamation of architectures to show that our best result is
reached with an ensemble of the lightweight GoogLe Nets tasked with
interpreting both the coronal caudal view and the mediolateral oblique view,
simply averaging the probability scores of both views to make the final
prediction. In addition, we have created a novel method to visualize what
features the neural network detects for the benign/malignant classification,
and have correlated those features with well known radiological features, such
as spiculation. Our algorithm significantly improves existing classification
methods for mammography lesions and identifies features that correlate with
established clinical markers.
"
21549,Boosting the kernelized shapelets: Theory and algorithms for local features,"  We consider binary classification problems using local features of objects.
One of motivating applications is time-series classification, where features
reflecting some local closeness measure between a time series and a pattern
sequence called shapelet are useful. Despite the empirical success of such
approaches using local features, the generalization ability of resulting
hypotheses is not fully understood and previous work relies on a bunch of
heuristics. In this paper, we formulate a class of hypotheses using local
features, where the richness of features is controlled by kernels. We derive
generalization bounds of sparse ensembles over the class which is exponentially
better than a standard analysis in terms of the number of possible local
features. The resulting optimization problem is well suited to the boosting
approach and the weak learning problem is formulated as a DC program, for which
practical algorithms exist. In preliminary experiments on time-series data
sets, our method achieves competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art
algorithms with small parameter-tuning cost.
"
21550,NeuRoute: Predictive Dynamic Routing for Software-Defined Networks,"  This paper introduces NeuRoute, a dynamic routing framework for Software
Defined Networks (SDN) entirely based on machine learning, specifically, Neural
Networks. Current SDN/OpenFlow controllers use a default routing based on
Dijkstra algorithm for shortest paths, and provide APIs to develop custom
routing applications. NeuRoute is a controller-agnostic dynamic routing
framework that (i) predicts traffic matrix in real time, (ii) uses a neural
network to learn traffic characteristics and (iii) generates forwarding rules
accordingly to optimize the network throughput. NeuRoute achieves the same
results as the most efficient dynamic routing heuristic but in much less
execution time.
"
21551,Improving the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure for Discrete Tests,"  To find interesting items in genome-wide association studies or next
generation sequencing data, a crucial point is to design powerful false
discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures that suitably combine discrete
tests (typically binomial or Fisher tests). In particular, recent research has
been striving for appropriate modifications of the classical Benjamini-Hochberg
(BH) step-up procedure that accommodate discreteness. However, despite an
important number of attempts, these procedures did not come with theoretical
guarantees. The present paper contributes to fill the gap: it presents new
modifications of the BH procedure that incorporate the discrete structure of
the data and provably control the FDR for any fixed number of null hypotheses
(under independence). Markedly, our FDR controlling methodology allows to
incorporate simultaneously the discreteness and the quantity of signal of the
data (corresponding therefore to a so-called $\pi\_0$-adaptive procedure). The
power advantage of the new methods is demonstrated in a numerical experiment
and for some appropriate real data sets.
"
21552,Emergent Supersymmetry in Local Equilibrium Systems,"  Many physical processes we observe in nature involve variations of
macroscopic quantities over spatial and temporal scales much larger than
microscopic molecular collision scales and can be considered as in local
thermal equilibrium. In this paper we show that any classical statistical
system in local thermal equilibrium has an emergent supersymmetry at low
energies. We use the framework of non-equilibrium effective field theory for
quantum many-body systems defined on a closed time path contour and consider
its classical limit. Unitarity of time evolution requires introducing
anti-commuting degrees of freedom and BRST symmetry which survive in the
classical limit. The local equilibrium is realized through a $Z_2$ dynamical
KMS symmetry. We show that supersymmetry is equivalent to the combination of
BRST and a specific consequence of the dynamical KMS symmetry, to which we
refer as the special dynamical KMS condition. In particular, we prove a theorem
stating that a system satisfying the special dynamical KMS condition is always
supersymmetrizable. We discuss a number of examples explicitly, including model
A for dynamical critical phenomena, a hydrodynamic theory of nonlinear
diffusion, and fluctuating hydrodynamics for relativistic charged fluids.
"
21553,Spectral identification of networks with inputs,"  We consider a network of interconnected dynamical systems. Spectral network
identification consists in recovering the eigenvalues of the network Laplacian
from the measurements of a very limited number (possibly one) of signals. These
eigenvalues allow to deduce some global properties of the network, such as
bounds on the node degree.
Having recently introduced this approach for autonomous networks of nonlinear
systems, we extend it here to treat networked systems with external inputs on
the nodes, in the case of linear dynamics. This is more natural in several
applications, and removes the need to sometimes use several independent
trajectories. We illustrate our framework with several examples, where we
estimate the mean, minimum, and maximum node degree in the network. Inferring
some information on the leading Laplacian eigenvectors, we also use our
framework in the context of network clustering.
"
21554,Asymptotic mapping class groups of closed surfaces punctured along Cantor sets,"  For $g\in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, we study a subgroup $\mathcal B_g
<\operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$ of asymptotically rigid mapping classes, for
$\Sigma_g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$ minus a Cantor set. The
group $\mathcal B_g$ contains the mapping class group of every compact
orientable surface of genus $g$ with non-empty boundary. We show that $\mathcal
B_g$ is finitely presented and that its $k$-th homology group coincides with
the stable homology of the mapping class group of genus $g$, for $k$ small
enough with respct to $g$. We then proceed to prove that the family of groups
so obtained enjoys a number of properties analogous to known results for
finite-type mapping class groups. More concretely, there are no (weakly)
injective maps $\mathcal B_h \to \mathcal B_g$ if $g<h$, every automorphism of
$\mathcal B_g$ is geometric, and every homomorphism from a higher-rank lattice
to $\mathcal B_g$ has finite image. In addition to the translation of classical
results about finite-type mapping class groups, we will show that $\mathcal
B_g$ is not linear, and does not have Kazhdan's Property (T). Finally, in
appendix we will study the group $\mathcal H_g$ of {\em half-twists} of
$\Sigma_g$, which sits between $\mathcal B_g$ and
$\operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$. More concretely, we will prove that $\mathcal
H_g$ is finitely presented, and that it is dense in
$\operatorname{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$.
"
21555,Vector Bundles over Projectivoid Line,"  In this article we describe vector bundles over projectivoid line and show
how it is similar to (and different) from Gorthendieck's classification of
vector bundles over projective line.
"
21556,Toward Robustness against Label Noise in Training Deep Discriminative Neural Networks,"  Collecting large training datasets, annotated with high-quality labels, is
costly and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework for training
deep convolutional neural networks from noisy labeled datasets that can be
obtained cheaply. The problem is formulated using an undirected graphical model
that represents the relationship between noisy and clean labels, trained in a
semi-supervised setting. In our formulation, the inference over latent clean
labels is tractable and is regularized during training using auxiliary sources
of information. The proposed model is applied to the image labeling problem and
is shown to be effective in labeling unseen images as well as reducing label
noise in training on CIFAR-10 and MS COCO datasets.
"
21557,Accurate estimation of microscopic diffusion anisotropy and its time dependence in the mouse brain,"  Microscopic diffusion anisotropy ({\mu}A) has been recently gaining
increasing attention for its ability to decouple the average compartment
anisotropy from orientation dispersion. Advanced diffusion MRI sequences, such
as double diffusion encoding (DDE) and double oscillating diffusion encoding
(DODE) have been used for mapping {\mu}A. However, the time-dependence of
{\mu}A has not been investigated insofar, and furthermore, the accuracy of
{\mu}A estimation vis-à-vis different b-values was not assessed. Here, we
investigate both these concepts using theory, simulation, and experiments in
the mouse brain. In the first part, simulations and experimental results show
that the conventional estimation of microscopic anisotropy from the difference
of D(O)DE sequences with parallel and orthogonal gradient directions yields
values that highly depend on the choice of b-value. To mitigate this
undesirable bias, we propose a multi-shell approach that harnesses a polynomial
fit of the signal difference up to third order terms in b-value. In
simulations, this approach yields more accurate {\mu}A metrics, which are
similar to the ground truth values. The second part of this work uses the
proposed multi-shell method to estimate the time/frequency dependence of
{\mu}A. The data shows an increase of {\mu}A with frequency, both in white and
gray matter regions. When comparing the experimental results with simulations,
it emerges that simple geometric models such as infinite cylinders with either
negligible or finite radii cannot replicate the measured trend, and more
complex models, which, for example, incorporate restrictions along the fibre
direction, are required. Thus, measuring the time dependence of microscopic
anisotropy can provide valuable information for characterizing tissue
microstructure.
"
21558,Baryogenesis from L-violating Higgs-doublet decay in the density-matrix formalism,"  We compute in the density-matrix formalism the baryon asymmetry generated by
the decay of the Higgs doublet into a right-handed (RH) neutrino and a Standard
Model lepton. The emphasis is put on the baryon asymmetry produced by the total
lepton-number violating decay. From the derivation of the corresponding
evolution equations, and from their integration, we find that this contribution
is fully relevant for large parts of the parameter space. This confirms the
results found recently in the CP-violating decay formalism with thermal
corrections and shows in particular that the lepton-number violating processes
are important not only for high-scale leptogenesis but also when the
RH-neutrino masses are in the GeV range. For large values of the Yukawa
couplings, we also find that the strong washout is generically much milder for
this total lepton-number violating part than for the usual RH-neutrino
oscillation flavour part.
"
21559,Improved Causal Discovery from Longitudinal Data Using a Mixture of DAGs,"  Many causal processes in biomedicine contain cycles and evolve. However, most
causal discovery algorithms assume that the underlying causal process follows a
single directed acyclic graph (DAG) that does not change over time. The
algorithms can therefore infer erroneous causal relations with high confidence
when run on real biomedical data. In this paper, I relax the single DAG
assumption by modeling causal processes using a mixture of DAGs so that the
graph can change over time. I then describe a causal discovery algorithm called
Causal Inference over Mixtures (CIM) to infer causal structure from a mixture
of DAGs using longitudinal data. CIM improves the accuracy of causal discovery
on both real and synthetic clinical datasets even when cycles,
non-stationarity, non-linearity, latent variables and selection bias exist
simultaneously.
"
21560,Replication or exploration? Sequential design for stochastic simulation experiments,"  We investigate the merits of replication, and provide methods for optimal
design (including replicates), with the goal of obtaining globally accurate
emulation of noisy computer simulation experiments. We first show that
replication can be beneficial from both design and computational perspectives,
in the context of Gaussian process surrogate modeling. We then develop a
lookahead based sequential design scheme that can determine if a new run should
be at an existing input location (i.e., replicate) or at a new one (explore).
When paired with a newly developed heteroskedastic Gaussian process model, our
dynamic design scheme facilitates learning of signal and noise relationships
which can vary throughout the input space. We show that it does so efficiently,
on both computational and statistical grounds. In addition to illustrative
synthetic examples, we demonstrate performance on two challenging real-data
simulation experiments, from inventory management and epidemiology.
"
21561,Instrumental variables as bias amplifiers with general outcome and confounding,"  Drawing causal inference with observational studies is the central pillar of
many disciplines. One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is
that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the
observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition
on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had
a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust
for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding
between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment
covariate might have greater bias than estimators without adjusting for this
covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes
instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder, and affect the
outcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this
phenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill in this gap in
the literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon
happens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity
assumptions. We further show that when the treatment follows an additive or
multiplicative model conditional on the instrumental variable and the
confounder, these monotonicity assumptions can be interpreted as the signs of
the arrows of the causal diagrams.
"
21562,The use of controlled vocabularies in requirements engineering activities: a protocol for a systematic literature review,"  Context: The Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) paradigm and the
planning phase of a systematic literature review. Objective: A protocol to do a
systematic literature review with detailed information about the processes
suggested by several guidelines in the field of evidence-based software
engineering. Method: An analisys of recent systematic literature reviews
published in world leading journals, plus the use of two renowned guidelines
and a textbook to sinthetise a formal plan (the protocol). Results: The
validated protocol Conclusions: We found that most of the published systematic
reviews lack on reporting the protocol, or it is weak. There is a lack of tool
support to develop formal protocols. Although a protocol, like a plan, must
have the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen situations, its objective is that
the actual activities should resemble as far as possible of those already
planned. Therefore, it is a difficult balance to achieve and, researchers must
be careful not to introduce alterations that could become threats to the
validity of the entire work.
"
21563,A Convex Framework for Fair Regression,"  We introduce a flexible family of fairness regularizers for (linear and
logistic) regression problems. These regularizers all enjoy convexity,
permitting fast optimization, and they span the rang from notions of group
fairness to strong individual fairness. By varying the weight on the fairness
regularizer, we can compute the efficient frontier of the accuracy-fairness
trade-off on any given dataset, and we measure the severity of this trade-off
via a numerical quantity we call the Price of Fairness (PoF). The centerpiece
of our results is an extensive comparative study of the PoF across six
different datasets in which fairness is a primary consideration.
"
21564,Identifying Growth-Patterns in Children by Applying Cluster analysis to Electronic Medical Records,"  Obesity is one of the leading health concerns in the United States.
Researchers and health care providers are interested in understanding factors
affecting obesity and detecting the likelihood of obesity as early as possible.
In this paper, we set out to recognize children who have higher risk of obesity
by identifying distinct growth patterns in them. This is done by using
clustering methods, which group together children who share similar body
measurements over a period of time. The measurements characterizing children
within the same cluster are plotted as a function of age. We refer to these
plots as growthpattern curves. We show that distinct growth-pattern curves are
associated with different clusters and thus can be used to separate children
into the topmost (heaviest), middle, or bottom-most cluster based on early
growth measurements.
"
21565,Waveform Design for Wireless Power Transfer with Limited Feedback,"  Waveform design is a key technique to jointly exploit a beamforming gain, the
channel frequency-selectivity and the rectifier nonlinearity, so as to enhance
the end-to-end power transfer efficiency of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT).
Those waveforms have been designed assuming perfect channel state information
at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on
limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective
channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the Energy Transmitter (ET)
transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder
within a codebook, and the Energy Receiver (ER) reports the index of the
precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the
waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in
each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease
in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback,
the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook
over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's
algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the
codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited
feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines,
achieving higher harvested energy.
"
21566,Relay synchronization in multiplex networks,"  Relay (or remote) synchronization between two not directly connected
oscillators in a network is an important feature allowing distant coordination.
In this work, we report a systematic study of this phenomenon in multiplex
networks, where inter-layer synchronization occurs between distant layers
mediated by a relay layer that acts as a transmitter. We show that this
transmission can be extended to higher order relay configurations, provided
symmetry conditions are preserved. By first order perturbative analysis, we
identify the dynamical and topological dependencies of relay synchronization in
a multiplex. We find that the relay synchronization threshold is considerably
reduced in a multiplex configuration, and that such synchronous state is mostly
supported by the lower degree nodes of the outer layers, while hubs can be
de-multiplexed without affecting overall coherence. Finally, we experimentally
validated the analytical and numerical findings by means of a multiplex of
three layers of electronic circuits.the analytical and numerical findings by
means of a multiplex of three layers of electronic circuits.
"
21567,Classification and Retrieval of Digital Pathology Scans: A New Dataset,"  In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, \textbf{Kimia Path24}, for image
classification and retrieval in digital pathology. We use the whole scan images
of 24 different tissue textures to generate 1,325 test patches of size
1000$\times$1000 (0.5mm$\times$0.5mm). Training data can be generated according
to preferences of algorithm designer and can range from approximately 27,000 to
over 50,000 patches if the preset parameters are adopted. We propose a compound
patch-and-scan accuracy measurement that makes achieving high accuracies quite
challenging. In addition, we set the benchmarking line by applying LBP,
dictionary approach and convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and report their
results. The highest accuracy was 41.80\% for CNN.
"
21568,Boundary Perimeter Bethe Ansatz,"  We study the partition function of the six-vertex model in the rational limit
on arbitrary Baxter lattices with reflecting boundary. Every such lattice is
interpreted as an invariant of the twisted Yangian. This identification allows
us to relate the partition function of the vertex model to the Bethe wave
function of an open spin chain. We obtain the partition function in terms of
creation operators on a reference state from the algebraic Bethe ansatz and as
a sum of permutations and reflections from the coordinate Bethe ansatz.
"
21569,Performance Modeling and Prediction for Dense Linear Algebra,"  This dissertation introduces measurement-based performance modeling and
prediction techniques for dense linear algebra algorithms. As a core principle,
these techniques avoid executions of such algorithms entirely, and instead
predict their performance through runtime estimates for the underlying compute
kernels. For a variety of operations, these predictions allow to quickly select
the fastest algorithm configurations from available alternatives. We consider
two scenarios that cover a wide range of computations:
To predict the performance of blocked algorithms, we design
algorithm-independent performance models for kernel operations that are
generated automatically once per platform. For various matrix operations,
instantaneous predictions based on such models both accurately identify the
fastest algorithm, and select a near-optimal block size.
For performance predictions of BLAS-based tensor contractions, we propose
cache-aware micro-benchmarks that take advantage of the highly regular
structure inherent to contraction algorithms. At merely a fraction of a
contraction's runtime, predictions based on such micro-benchmarks identify the
fastest combination of tensor traversal and compute kernel.
"
21570,On the Numerical Solution of Fourth-Order Linear Two-Point Boundary Value Problems,"  This paper introduces a fast and numerically stable algorithm for the
solution of fourth-order linear boundary value problems on an interval. This
type of equation arises in a variety of settings in physics and signal
processing. However, current methods of solution involve discretizing the
differential equation directly by finite elements or finite differences, and
consequently suffer from the poor conditioning introduced by such schemes. Our
new method instead reformulates the equation as a collection of second-kind
integral equations defined on local subdomains. Each such equation can be
stably discretized. The boundary values of these local solutions are matched by
solving a banded linear system. The method of deferred corrections is then used
to increase the accuracy of the scheme. Deferred corrections requires applying
the integral operator to a function on the entire domain, for which we provide
an algorithm with linear cost. We illustrate the performance of our method on
several numerical examples.
"
21571,Bayesian estimation of thermonuclear reaction rates for deuterium+deuterium reactions,"  The study of d+d reactions is of major interest since their reaction rates
affect the predicted abundances of D, 3He, and 7Li. In particular, recent
measurements of primordial D/H ratios call for reduced uncertainties in the
theoretical abundances predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Different
authors have studied reactions involved in BBN by incorporating new
experimental data and a careful treatment of systematic and probabilistic
uncertainties. To analyze the experimental data, Coc et al. (2015) used results
of ab initio models for the theoretical calculation of the energy dependence of
S-factors in conjunction with traditional statistical methods based on Chi-2
minimization. Bayesian methods have now spread to many scientific fields and
provide numerous advantages in data analysis. Astrophysical S-factors and
reaction rates using Bayesian statistics were calculated by Iliadis et al.
(2016). Here we present a similar analysis for two d+d reactions, d(d,n)3He and
d(d,p)3H, that has been translated into a total decrease of the predicted D/H
value by 0.16%.
"
21572,Detecting and Explaining Crisis,"  Individuals on social media may reveal themselves to be in various states of
crisis (e.g. suicide, self-harm, abuse, or eating disorders). Detecting crisis
from social media text automatically and accurately can have profound
consequences. However, detecting a general state of crisis without explaining
why has limited applications. An explanation in this context is a coherent,
concise subset of the text that rationalizes the crisis detection. We explore
several methods to detect and explain crisis using a combination of neural and
non-neural techniques. We evaluate these techniques on a unique data set
obtained from Koko, an anonymous emotional support network available through
various messaging applications. We annotate a small subset of the samples
labeled with crisis with corresponding explanations. Our best technique
significantly outperforms the baseline for detection and explanation.
"
21573,From functors between categories to homomorphisms of C-systems,"  We prove a theorem, motivated by a conjecture of Voevodsky on C-systems, that
provides, under some assumptions, a lift of a functor with a C-system as domain
and a category as codomain, to a homomorphism of C-systems.
"
21574,FiLM: Visual Reasoning with a General Conditioning Layer,"  We introduce a general-purpose conditioning method for neural networks called
FiLM: Feature-wise Linear Modulation. FiLM layers influence neural network
computation via a simple, feature-wise affine transformation based on
conditioning information. We show that FiLM layers are highly effective for
visual reasoning - answering image-related questions which require a
multi-step, high-level process - a task which has proven difficult for standard
deep learning methods that do not explicitly model reasoning. Specifically, we
show on visual reasoning tasks that FiLM layers 1) halve state-of-the-art error
for the CLEVR benchmark, 2) modulate features in a coherent manner, 3) are
robust to ablations and architectural modifications, and 4) generalize well to
challenging, new data from few examples or even zero-shot.
"
21575,Stability of charge-stripe ordered La2-xSrxNiO4+delta at one third doping,"  The stability of charge ordered phases is doping dependent, with different
materials having particularly stable ordered phases. In the half filled charge
ordered phases of the cuprates this occurs at one eighth doping, whereas in
charge-stripe ordered La2-xSrxNiO4+delta there is enhanced stability at one
third doping. In this paper we discuss the known details of the charge-stripe
order in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta, and how these properties lead to the one third
doping stability.
"
21576,Primal-Dual $π$ Learning: Sample Complexity and Sublinear Run Time for Ergodic Markov Decision Problems,"  Consider the problem of approximating the optimal policy of a Markov decision
process (MDP) by sampling state transitions. In contrast to existing
reinforcement learning methods that are based on successive approximations to
the nonlinear Bellman equation, we propose a Primal-Dual $\pi$ Learning method
in light of the linear duality between the value and policy. The $\pi$ learning
method is model-free and makes primal-dual updates to the policy and value
vectors as new data are revealed. For infinite-horizon undiscounted Markov
decision process with finite state space $S$ and finite action space $A$, the
$\pi$ learning method finds an $\epsilon$-optimal policy using the following
number of sample transitions $$ \tilde{O}( \frac{(\tau\cdot t^*_{mix})^2 |S|
|A| }{\epsilon^2} ),$$ where $t^*_{mix}$ is an upper bound of mixing times
across all policies and $\tau$ is a parameter characterizing the range of
stationary distributions across policies. The $\pi$ learning method also
applies to the computational problem of MDP where the transition probabilities
and rewards are explicitly given as the input. In the case where each state
transition can be sampled in $\tilde{O}(1)$ time, the $\pi$ learning method
gives a sublinear-time algorithm for solving the averaged-reward MDP.
"
21577,Automorphisms of pure braid Groups,"  In this paper, we investigate the structure of the automorphism groups of
pure braid groups. We prove that, for $n>3$, $\Aut(P_n)$ is generated by the
subgroup $\Aut_c(P_n)$ of central automorphisms of $P_n$, the subgroup
$\Aut(B_n)$ of restrictions of automorphisms of $B_n$ on $P_n$ and one extra
automorphism $w_n$. We also investigate the lifting and extension problem for
automorphisms of some well-known exact sequences arising from braid groups, and
prove that that answers are negative in most cases. Specifically, we prove that
no non-trivial central automorphism of $P_n$ can be extended to an automorphism
of $B_n$.
"
21578,Spin phonon interactions and magneto-thermal transport behavior in p-Si,"  The spin-phonon interaction is the dominant process for spin relaxation in
Si, and as thermal transport in Si is dominated by phonons, one would expect
spin polarization to influence Si's thermal conductivity. Here we report the
experimental evidence of just such a coupling. We have performed concurrent
measurements of spin, charge, and phonon transport in p-doped Si across a wide
range of temperatures. In an experimental system of a freestanding two um p-Si
beam coated on one side with a thin (25 nm) ferromagnetic spin injection layer,
we use the self-heating 3 omega method to measure changes in electrical and
thermal conductivity under the influence of a magnetic field. These
magneto-thermal transport measurements reveal signatures in the variation of
electrical and thermal transport that are consistent with spin-phonon
interaction. Raman spectroscopy measurements and first principle's calculations
support that these variations are due to spin-phonon interaction. Spin
polarization leads to softening of phonon modes, a reduction in the group
velocity of acoustic modes, and a subsequent decrease in thermal conductivity
at room temperature. Moreover, magneto-thermal transport measurements as a
function of temperature indicate a change in the spin-phonon relaxation
behavior at low temperature.
"
21579,Benchmark of dynamic electron correlation models for seniority-zero wavefunctions and their application to thermochemistry,"  Wavefunctions restricted to electron-pair states are promising models to
describe static/nondynamic electron correlation effects encountered, for
instance, in bond-dissociation processes and transition-metal and actinide
chemistry. To reach spectroscopic accuracy, however, the missing dynamic
electron correlation effects that cannot be described by electron-pair states
need to be included \textit{a posteriori}. In this article, we extend the
previously presented perturbation theory models with an Antisymmetric Product
of 1-reference orbital Geminal (AP1roG) reference function that allow us to
describe both static/nondynamic and dynamic electron correlation effects.
Specifically, our perturbation theory models combine a diagonal and
off-diagonal zero-order Hamiltonian, a single-reference and multi-reference
dual state, and different excitation operators used to construct the projection
manifold. We benchmark all proposed models as well as an \textit{a posteriori}
linearized coupled cluster correction on top of AP1roG against CR-CCSD(T)
reference data for reaction energies of several closed-shell molecules that are
extrapolated to the basis set limit. Moreover, we test the performance of our
new methods for multiple bond breaking processes in the N$_2$, C$_2$, and BN
dimers against MRCI-SD and MRCI-SD+Q reference data. Our numerical results
indicate that the best performance is obtained from a linearized coupled
cluster correction as well as second-order perturbation theory corrections
employing a diagonal and off-diagonal zero-order Hamiltonian and a
single-determinant dual state. These dynamic corrections on top of AP1roG allow
us to reliably model molecular systems dominated by static/nondynamic as well
as dynamic electron correlation.
"
21580,Noncommutative resolutions of discriminants,"  We give an introduction to the McKay correspondence and its connection to
quotients of $\mathbb{C}^n$ by finite reflection groups. This yields a natural
construction of noncommutative resolutions of the discriminants of these
reflection groups. This paper is an extended version of E.F.'s talk with the
same title delivered at the ICRA.
"
21581,Machine Learning $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Quantum Spin Liquids with Quasi-particle Statistics,"  After decades of progress and effort, obtaining a phase diagram for a
strongly-correlated topological system still remains a challenge. Although in
principle one could turn to Wilson loops and long-range entanglement,
evaluating these non-local observables at many points in phase space can be
prohibitively costly. With growing excitement over topological quantum
computation comes the need for an efficient approach for obtaining topological
phase diagrams. Here we turn to machine learning using quantum loop topography
(QLT), a notion we have recently introduced. Specifically, we propose a
construction of QLT that is sensitive to quasi-particle statistics. We then use
mutual statistics between the spinons and visons to detect a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
quantum spin liquid in a multi-parameter phase space. We successfully obtain
the quantum phase boundary between the topological and trivial phases using a
simple feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, we demonstrate advantages of
our approach for the evaluation of phase diagrams relating to speed and
storage. Such statistics-based machine learning of topological phases opens new
efficient routes to studying topological phase diagrams in strongly correlated
systems.
"
21582,Visually Grounded Word Embeddings and Richer Visual Features for Improving Multimodal Neural Machine Translation,"  In Multimodal Neural Machine Translation (MNMT), a neural model generates a
translated sentence that describes an image, given the image itself and one
source descriptions in English. This is considered as the multimodal image
caption translation task. The images are processed with Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to extract visual features exploitable by the translation model.
So far, the CNNs used are pre-trained on object detection and localization
task. We hypothesize that richer architecture, such as dense captioning models,
may be more suitable for MNMT and could lead to improved translations. We
extend this intuition to the word-embeddings, where we compute both linguistic
and visual representation for our corpus vocabulary. We combine and compare
different confi
"
21583,Delay-time distribution of core-collapse supernovae with late events resulting from binary interaction,"  Most massive stars, the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, are in close
binary systems and may interact with their companion through mass transfer or
merging. We undertake a population synthesis study to compute the delay-time
distribution of core-collapse supernovae, that is, the supernova rate versus
time following a starburst, taking into account binary interactions. We test
the systematic robustness of our results by running various simulations to
account for the uncertainties in our standard assumptions. We find that a
significant fraction, $15^{+9}_{-8}$%, of core-collapse supernovae are `late',
that is, they occur 50-200 Myrs after birth, when all massive single stars have
already exploded. These late events originate predominantly from binary systems
with at least one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of
intermediate mass ($4-8M_{\odot}$). The main evolutionary channels that
contribute often involve either the merging of the initially more massive
primary star with its companion or the engulfment of the remaining core of the
primary by the expanding secondary that has accreted mass at an earlier
evolutionary stage. Also, the total number of core-collapse supernovae
increases by $14^{+15}_{-14}$% because of binarity for the same initial stellar
mass. The high rate implies that we should have already observed such late
core-collapse supernovae, but have not recognized them as such. We argue that
$\phi$ Persei is a likely progenitor and that eccentric neutron star - white
dwarf systems are likely descendants. Late events can help explain the
discrepancy in the delay-time distributions derived from supernova remnants in
the Magellanic Clouds and extragalactic type Ia events, lowering the
contribution of prompt Ia events. We discuss ways to test these predictions and
speculate on the implications for supernova feedback in simulations of galaxy
evolution.
"
21584,Ignore or Comply? On Breaking Symmetry in Consensus,"  We study consensus processes on the complete graph of $n$ nodes. Initially,
each node supports one from up to n opinions. Nodes randomly and in parallel
sample the opinions of constant many nodes. Based on these samples, they use an
update rule to change their own opinion.
The goal is to reach consensus, a configuration where all nodes support the
same opinion. We compare two well-known update rules: 2-Choices and 3-Majority.
In the former, each node samples two nodes and adopts their opinion if they
agree. In the latter, each node samples three nodes: If an opinion is supported
by at least two samples the node adopts it, otherwise it randomly adopts one of
the sampled opinions. Known results for these update rules focus on initial
configurations with a limited number of colors (say $n^{1/3}$ ), or typically
assume a bias, where one opinion has a much larger support than any other. For
such biased configurations, the time to reach consensus is roughly the same for
2-Choices and 3-Majority.
Interestingly, we prove that this is no longer true for configurations with a
large number of initial colors. In particular, we show that 3-Majority reaches
consensus with high probability in $O(n^{3/4}\log^{7/8}n)$ rounds, while
2-Choices can need $\Omega(n/\log n)$ rounds. We thus get the first
unconditional sublinear bound for 3-Majority and the first result separating
the consensus time of these processes. Along the way, we develop a framework
that allows a fine-grained comparison between consensus processes from a
specific class. We believe that this framework might help to classify the
performance of more consensus processes.
"
21585,End to End Vehicle Lateral Control Using a Single Fisheye Camera,"  Convolutional neural networks are commonly used to control the steering angle
for autonomous cars. Most of the time, multiple long range cameras are used to
generate lateral failure cases. In this paper we present a novel model to
generate this data and label augmentation using only one short range fisheye
camera. We present our simulator and how it can be used as a consistent metric
for lateral end-to-end control evaluation. Experiments are conducted on a
custom dataset corresponding to more than 10000 km and 200 hours of open road
driving. Finally we evaluate this model on real world driving scenarios, open
road and a custom test track with challenging obstacle avoidance and sharp
turns. In our simulator based on real-world videos, the final model was capable
of more than 99% autonomy on urban road
"
21586,Metrics for Deep Generative Models,"  Neural samplers such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative
adversarial networks (GANs) approximate distributions by transforming samples
from a simple random source---the latent space---to samples from a more complex
distribution represented by a dataset. While the manifold hypothesis implies
that the density induced by a dataset contains large regions of low density,
the training criterions of VAEs and GANs will make the latent space densely
covered. Consequently points that are separated by low-density regions in
observation space will be pushed together in latent space, making stationary
distances poor proxies for similarity. We transfer ideas from Riemannian
geometry to this setting, letting the distance between two points be the
shortest path on a Riemannian manifold induced by the transformation. The
method yields a principled distance measure, provides a tool for visual
inspection of deep generative models, and an alternative to linear
interpolation in latent space. In addition, it can be applied for robot
movement generalization using previously learned skills. The method is
evaluated on a synthetic dataset with known ground truth; on a simulated robot
arm dataset; on human motion capture data; and on a generative model of
handwritten digits.
"
21587,Posterior Inference for Sparse Hierarchical Non-stationary Models,"  Gaussian processes are valuable tools for non-parametric modelling, where
typically an assumption of stationarity is employed. While removing this
assumption can improve prediction, fitting such models is challenging. In this
work, hierarchical models are constructed based on Gaussian Markov random
fields with stochastic spatially varying parameters. Importantly, this allows
for non-stationarity while also addressing the computational burden through a
sparse representation of the precision matrix. The prior field is chosen to be
Matérn, and two hyperpriors, for the spatially varying parameters, are
considered. One hyperprior is Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, formulated through an
autoregressive process. The other corresponds to the widely used squared
exponential. In this setting, efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling is challenging due to the strong coupling a posteriori of the
parameters and hyperparameters. We develop and compare three MCMC schemes,
which are adaptive and therefore free of parameter tuning. Furthermore, a novel
extension to higher-dimensional settings is proposed through an additive
structure that retains the flexibility and scalability of the model, while also
inheriting interpretability from the additive approach. A thorough assessment
of the ability of the methods to efficiently explore the posterior distribution
and to account for non-stationarity is presented, in both simulated experiments
and a real-world computer emulation problem.
"
21588,A Semiotics-inspired Domain-Specific Modeling Language for Complex Event Processing Rules,"  Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one technique used to the handling data
flows. It allows pre-establishing conditions through rules and firing events
when certain patterns are found in the data flows. Because the rules for
defining such patterns are expressed with specific languages, users of these
technologies must understand the underlying expression syntax. To reduce the
complexity of writing CEP rules, some researchers are employing Domain Specific
Modeling Language (DSML) to provide modelling through visual tools. However,
existing approaches are ignoring some user design techniques that facilitate
usability. Thus, resulting tools eventually has become more complexes for
handling CEP than the conventional usage. Also, research on DSML tools
targeting CEP does not present any evaluation around usability. This article
proposes a DSML combined with visual notations techniques to create CEP rules
with a more intuitive development model adapted for the non-expert user needs.
The resulting tool was evaluated by non-expert users that were capable of
easily creating CEP rules without prior knowledge of the underlying expression
language.

21589,Fairly Dividing a Cake after Some Parts Were Burnt in the Oven,"  There is a heterogeneous resource that contains both good parts and bad
parts, for example, a cake with some parts burnt, a land-estate with some parts
heavily taxed, or a chore with some parts fun to do. The resource has to be
divided fairly among $n$ agents with different preferences, each of whom has a
personal value-density function on the resource. The value-density functions
can accept any real value --- positive, negative or zero. Each agent should
receive a connected piece and no agent should envy another agent. We prove that
such a division exists for 3 agents and present preliminary positive results
for larger numbers of agents.
"
21590,"Atomic vapor as a source of tunable, non-Gaussian self-reconstructing optical modes","  In this manuscript, we demonstrate the ability of nonlinear light-atom
interactions to produce tunably non-Gaussian, partially self-healing optical
modes. Gaussian spatial-mode light tuned near to the atomic resonances in hot
rubidium vapor is shown to result in non-Gaussian output mode structures that
may be controlled by varying either the input beam power or the temperature of
the atomic vapor. We show that the output modes exhibit a degree of
self-reconstruction after encountering an obstruction in the beam path. The
resultant modes are similar to truncated Bessel-Gauss modes that exhibit the
ability to self-reconstruct earlier upon propagation than Gaussian modes. The
ability to generate tunable, self-reconstructing beams has potential
applications to a variety of imaging and communication scenarios.

21591,Understanding Performance of Edge Content Caching for Mobile Video Streaming,"  Today's Internet has witnessed an increase in the popularity of mobile video
streaming, which is expected to exceed 3/4 of the global mobile data traffic by
2019. To satisfy the considerable amount of mobile video requests, video
service providers have been pushing their content delivery infrastructure to
edge networks--from regional CDN servers to peer CDN servers (e.g.,
smartrouters in users' homes)--to cache content and serve users with storage
and network resources nearby. Among the edge network content caching paradigms,
Wi-Fi access point caching and cellular base station caching have become two
mainstream solutions. Thus, understanding the effectiveness and performance of
these solutions for large-scale mobile video delivery is important. However,
the characteristics and request patterns of mobile video streaming are unclear
in practical wireless network. In this paper, we use real-world datasets
containing 50 million trace items of nearly 2 million users viewing more than
0.3 million unique videos using mobile devices in a metropolis in China over 2
weeks, not only to understand the request patterns and user behaviors in mobile
video streaming, but also to evaluate the effectiveness of Wi-Fi and
cellular-based edge content caching solutions. To understand performance of
edge content caching for mobile video streaming, we first present temporal and
spatial video request patterns, and we analyze their impacts on caching
performance using frequency-domain and entropy analysis approaches. We then
study the behaviors of mobile video users, including their mobility and
geographical migration behaviors. Using trace-driven experiments, we compare
strategies for edge content caching including LRU and LFU, in terms of
supporting mobile video requests. Moreover, we design an efficient caching
strategy based on the measurement insights and experimentally evaluate its
performance.
"
21592,Combination of Hidden Markov Random Field and Conjugate Gradient for Brain Image Segmentation,"  Image segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into significant
regions easier to analyze. Nowadays, segmentation has become a necessity in
many practical medical imaging methods as locating tumors and diseases. Hidden
Markov Random Field model is one of several techniques used in image
segmentation. It provides an elegant way to model the segmentation process.
This modeling leads to the minimization of an objective function. Conjugate
Gradient algorithm (CG) is one of the best known optimization techniques. This
paper proposes the use of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm (CG) for image
segmentation, based on the Hidden Markov Random Field. Since derivatives are
not available for this expression, finite differences are used in the CG
algorithm to approximate the first derivative. The approach is evaluated using
a number of publicly available images, where ground truth is known. The Dice
Coefficient is used as an objective criterion to measure the quality of
segmentation. The results show that the proposed CG approach compares favorably
with other variants of Hidden Markov Random Field segmentation algorithms.

21593,Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for Explainable Recommendations,"  In this paper, we tackle the problem of explanations in a deep-learning based
model for recommendations by leveraging the technique of layer-wise relevance
propagation. We use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to extract relevant
features from the input images before identifying similarity between the images
in feature space. Relationships between the images are identified by the model
and layer-wise relevance propagation is used to infer pixel-level details of
the images that may have significantly informed the model's choice. We evaluate
our method on an Amazon products dataset and demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach.
"
21594,Compressed channeled spectropolarimetry,"  Channeled spectropolarimetry measures the spectrally resolved Stokes
parameters. A key aspect of this technique is to accurately reconstruct the
Stokes parameters from a modulated measurement of the channeled
spectropolarimeter. The state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithm uses the
Fourier transform to extract the Stokes parameters from channels in the Fourier
domain. While this approach is straightforward, it can be sensitive to noise
and channel cross-talk, and it imposes bandwidth limitations that cut off high
frequency details. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a reconstruction
method called compressed channeled spectropolarimetry. In our proposed
framework, reconstruction in channeled spectropolarimetry is an underdetermined
problem, where we take N measurements and solve for 3N unknown Stokes
parameters. We formulate an optimization problem by creating a mathematical
model of the channeled spectropolarimeter with inspiration from compressed
sensing. We show that our approach offers greater noise robustness and
reconstruction accuracy compared with the Fourier transform technique in
simulations and experimental measurements. By demonstrating more accurate
reconstructions, we push performance to the native resolution of the sensor,
allowing more information to be recovered from a single measurement of a
channeled spectropolarimeter.
"
21595,Limits for Rumor Spreading in stochastic populations,"  Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield
emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made
systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the
structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well
understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of
such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of
rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must
reliably flow into the rest of the population.
In order to study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups
that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task, we consider a noisy
version of the uniform PULL model. We prove a lower bound which implies that,
in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the
communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which
agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources. Our results
thus show an exponential separation between the uniform PUSH and PULL
communication models in the presence of noise. Such separation may be
interpreted as suggesting that, in order to achieve efficient rumor spreading,
a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or,
alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise.
We corroborate our theoretical findings with a new analysis of experimental
data regarding recruitment in Cataglyphis niger desert ants.
"
21596,Approximability of Discriminators Implies Diversity in GANs,"  While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced
impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent work
has shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse. The
theoretical work of Arora et al. suggests a dilemma about GANs' statistical
properties: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak
discriminators cannot detect mode collapse.
In contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn
distributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with
polynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong
distinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against
all possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of
Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible neural networks generators, we
design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets of specific
architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) induced by the
discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance and/or
KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the
learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance
or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes. Our preliminary experiments show
that on synthetic datasets the test IPM is well correlated with KL divergence,
indicating that the lack of diversity may be caused by the sub-optimality in
optimization instead of statistical inefficiency.
"
21597,Identifying Nonlinear 1-Step Causal Influences in Presence of Latent Variables,"  We propose an approach for learning the causal structure in stochastic
dynamical systems with a $1$-step functional dependency in the presence of
latent variables. We propose an information-theoretic approach that allows us
to recover the causal relations among the observed variables as long as the
latent variables evolve without exogenous noise. We further propose an
efficient learning method based on linear regression for the special sub-case
when the dynamics are restricted to be linear. We validate the performance of
our approach via numerical simulations.
"
21598,The discovery of tidal tails around the globular cluster NGC 7492 with Pan-STARRS1,"  We report the discovery of tidal tails around the Galactic globular cluster
NGC 7492, based on the Data Release 1 of the Pan-STARRS 1 survey. The tails
were detected with a version of the matched filter technique applied to the
$(g-r,r)$ and $(g-i,i)$ color-magnitude diagrams. Tidal tails emerging from the
cluster extend at least $\sim$3.5 degrees in the North-East to South-East
direction, equivalent to $\sim1.5$ kpc in projected length.
"
21599,Strong 2.t and Strong 3.t Transformations for Strong M-equivalence,"  Parikh matrices have been extensively investigated due to their usefulness in
studying subword occurrences in words. Due to the dependency of Parikh matrices
on the ordering of the alphabet, strong M-equivalence was proposed as an
order-independent alternative to M-equivalence in studying words possessing the
same Parikh matrix. This paper introduces and studies the notions of strong 2.t
and strong 3.t transformations in determining when two ternary words are
strongly M-equivalent. The irreducibility of strong 2.t transformations are
then scrutinized, exemplified by a structural characterization of irreducible
strong 2.2 transformations. The common limitation of these transformations in
characterizing strong M-equivalence is then addressed.
"
21600,Integrals of eigenfunctions over curves in surfaces of nonpositive curvature,"  Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonpositive
sectional curvature. Let $\Delta_g$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator
corresponding to the metric $g$ on $M$, and let $e_\lambda$ be $L^2$-normalized
eigenfunctions of $\Delta_g$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, i.e. \[ -\Delta_g
e_\lambda = \lambda^2 e_\lambda. \] We prove \[ \left| \int_{\mathbb R} b(t)
e_\lambda (\gamma(t)) \, dt \right| = o(1) \quad \text{ as } \lambda \to \infty
\] where $b$ is a smooth, compactly supported function on $\mathbb R$ and
$\gamma$ is a curve parametrized by arc-length whose geodesic curvature
$\kappa(\gamma(t))$ avoids two critical curvatures $\mathbf
k(\gamma'^\perp(t))$ and $\mathbf k(-\gamma'^{\perp}(t))$ for each $t \in
\operatorname{supp} b$. $\mathbf k(v)$ denotes the curvature of a circle with
center taken to infinity along the geodesic ray in direction $-v$.
"
21601,Wavenet based low rate speech coding,"  Traditional parametric coding of speech facilitates low rate but provides
poor reconstruction quality because of the inadequacy of the model used. We
describe how a WaveNet generative speech model can be used to generate high
quality speech from the bit stream of a standard parametric coder operating at
2.4 kb/s. We compare this parametric coder with a waveform coder based on the
same generative model and show that approximating the signal waveform incurs a
large rate penalty. Our experiments confirm the high performance of the WaveNet
based coder and show that the speech produced by the system is able to
additionally perform implicit bandwidth extension and does not significantly
impair recognition of the original speaker for the human listener, even when
that speaker has not been used during the training of the generative model.
"
21602,On Synchronization of Dynamical Systems over Directed Switching Topologies: An Algebraic and Geometric Perspective,"  In this paper, we aim to investigate the synchronization problem of dynamical
systems, which can be of generic linear or Lipschitz nonlinear type,
communicating over directed switching network topologies. A mild connectivity
assumption on the switching topologies is imposed, which allows them to be
directed and jointly connected. We propose a novel analysis framework from both
algebraic and geometric perspectives to justify the attractiveness of the
synchronization manifold. Specifically, it is proven that the complementary
space of the synchronization manifold can be spanned by certain subspaces.
These subspaces can be the eigenspaces of the nonzero eigenvalues of Laplacian
matrices in linear case. They can also be subspaces in which the projection of
the nonlinear self-dynamics still retains the Lipschitz property. This allows
to project the states of the dynamical systems into these subspaces and
transform the synchronization problem under consideration equivalently into a
convergence one of the projected states in each subspace. Then, assuming the
joint connectivity condition on the communication topologies, we are able to
work out a simple yet effective and unified convergence analysis for both types
of dynamical systems. More specifically, for partial-state coupled generic
linear systems, it is proven that synchronization can be reached if an extra
condition, which is easy to verify in several cases, on the system dynamics is
satisfied. For Lipschitz-type nonlinear systems with positive-definite inner
coupling matrix, synchronization is realized if the coupling strength is strong
enough to stabilize the evolution of the projected states in each subspace
under certain conditions.
"
21603,"Independence, Conditionality and Structure of Dempster-Shafer Belief Functions","  Several approaches of structuring (factorization, decomposition) of
Dempster-Shafer joint belief functions from literature are reviewed with
special emphasis on their capability to capture independence from the point of
view of the claim that belief functions generalize bayes notion of probability.
It is demonstrated that Zhu and Lee's {Zhu:93} logical networks and Smets'
{Smets:93} directed acyclic graphs are unable to capture statistical
dependence/independence of bayesian networks {Pearl:88}. On the other hand,
though Shenoy and Shafer's hypergraphs can explicitly represent bayesian
network factorization of bayesian belief functions, they disclaim any need for
representation of independence of variables in belief functions.
Cano et al. {Cano:93} reject the hypergraph representation of Shenoy and
Shafer just on grounds of missing representation of variable independence, but
in their frameworks some belief functions factorizable in Shenoy/Shafer
framework cannot be factored.
The approach in {Klopotek:93f} on the other hand combines the merits of both
Cano et al. and of Shenoy/Shafer approach in that for Shenoy/Shafer approach no
simpler factorization than that in {Klopotek:93f} approach exists and on the
other hand all independences among variables captured in Cano et al. framework
and many more are captured in {Klopotek:93f} approach.%
"
21604,Wave Manipulations by Coherent Perfect Channeling,"  We report experimental and theoretical investigations of coherent perfect
channeling (CPC), a process that two incoming coherent waves in waveguides are
completely channeled into one or two other waveguides with little energy
dissipation via strong coherent interaction between the two waves mediated by a
deep subwavelength dimension scatterer at the common junction of the
waveguides. Two such scatterers for acoustic waves are discovered, one
confirmed by experiments and the other predicted by theory, and their
scattering matrices are formulated. Scatterers with other CPC scattering
matrices are explored, and preliminary investigations of their properties are
conducted. The scattering matrix formulism makes it possible to extend the
applicable domain of CPC to other scalar waves, such as electromagnetic waves
and quantum wavefunctions.
"
21605,The Coldest Place in the Universe: Probing the Ultra-Cold Outflow and Dusty Disk in the Boomerang Nebula,"  Our Cycle 0 ALMA observations confirmed that the Boomerang Nebula is the
coldest known object in the Universe, with a massive high-speed outflow that
has cooled significantly below the cosmic background temperature. Our new CO
1-0 data reveal heretofore unseen distant regions of this ultra-cold outflow,
out to $\gtrsim120,000$ AU. We find that in the ultra-cold outflow, the
mass-loss rate (dM/dt) increases with radius, similar to its expansion velocity
($V$) - taking $V\propto r$, we find $dM/dt \propto r^{0.9-2.2}$. The mass in
the ultra-cold outflow is $\gtrsim3.3$ Msun, and the Boomerang's main-sequence
progenitor mass is $\gtrsim4$ Msun. Our high angular resolution ($\sim$0"".3) CO
J=3-2 map shows the inner bipolar nebula's precise, highly-collimated shape,
and a dense central waist of size (FWHM) $\sim$1740 AU$\times275$ AU. The
molecular gas and the dust as seen in scattered light via optical HST imaging
show a detailed correspondence. The waist shows a compact core in thermal dust
emission at 0.87-3.3 mm, which harbors $(4-7)\times10^{-4}$ Msun~of very large
($\sim$mm-to-cm sized), cold ($\sim20-30$ K) grains. The central waist
(assuming its outer regions to be expanding) and fast bipolar outflow have
expansion ages of $\lesssim1925$ yr and $\le1050$ yr: the ""jet-lag"" (i.e.,
torus age minus the fast-outflow age) in the Boomerang supports models in which
the primary star interacts directly with a binary companion. We argue that this
interaction resulted in a common-envelope configuration while the Boomerang's
primary was an RGB or early-AGB star, with the companion finally merging into
the primary's core, and ejecting the primary's envelope that now forms the
ultra-cold outflow.
"
21606,The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: High-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of 324 survey stars,"  The CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to search
for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the survey sample by
publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These spectra cover the
wavelength range 520--1710nm at a resolution of at least $R > 80,000$, and we
measure its RV, H$\alpha$ emission, and projected rotation velocity. We present
an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to
atmospheric models. To quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in
low-mass stars over the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical
information on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare
our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine
the spectroscopic RV information content, $Q$, and signal-to-noise ratio. We
find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be reached in the
wavelength range 700--900nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally
precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We demonstrate that
in this spectroscopic range, the large amount of absorption features
compensates for the intrinsic faintness of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision
of 1ms$^{-1}$ in very low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires
the use of a 10m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the
combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search
for low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar
variability. At a 4m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the
potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of
3-4ms$^{-1}$.
"
21607,Convolutional Neural Knowledge Graph Learning,"  Previous models for learning entity and relationship embeddings of knowledge
graphs such as TransE, TransH, and TransR aim to explore new links based on
learned representations. However, these models interpret relationships as
simple translations on entity embeddings. In this paper, we try to learn more
complex connections between entities and relationships. In particular, we use a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn entity and relationship
representations in knowledge graphs. In our model, we treat entities and
relationships as one-dimensional numerical sequences with the same length.
After that, we combine each triplet of head, relationship, and tail together as
a matrix with height 3. CNN is applied to the triplets to get confidence
scores. Positive and manually corrupted negative triplets are used to train the
embeddings and the CNN model simultaneously. Experimental results on public
benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art
models on exploring unseen relationships, which proves that CNN is effective to
learn complex interactive patterns between entities and relationships.
"
21608,Cost-Sensitive Approach to Batch Size Adaptation for Gradient Descent,"  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically determine the
batch size in stochastic gradient descent methods. The choice of the batch size
induces a trade-off between the accuracy of the gradient estimate and the cost
in terms of samples of each update. We propose to determine the batch size by
optimizing the ratio between a lower bound to a linear or quadratic Taylor
approximation of the expected improvement and the number of samples used to
estimate the gradient. The performance of the proposed approach is empirically
compared with related methods on popular classification tasks.
The work was presented at the NIPS workshop on Optimizing the Optimizers.
Barcelona, Spain, 2016.
"
21609,Existence and uniqueness of solution for a nonhomogeneous nonlocal problem,"  In this paper we investigate a class of elliptic problems involving a
nonlocal Kirchhoff type operator with variable coefficients and data changing
its sign. Under appropriated conditions on the coefficients, we have shown
existence and uniqueness of solution.
"
21610,Large deviations theory approach to cosmic shear calculations: the one-point aperture mass,"  This paper presents a general formalism that allows the derivation of the
cumulant generating function and one-point Probability Distribution Function
(PDF) of the aperture mass ($\hat{M}_{ap}$), a common observable for cosmic
shear observations. Our formalism is based on the Large Deviation Principle
(LDP) applied, in such cosmological context, to an arbitrary set of densities
in concentric cells. We show here that the LDP can indeed be used for a much
larger family of observables than previously envisioned, such as those built
from continuous and nonlinear functionals of the density profiles. The general
expression of the observable aperture mass depends on reduced shear profile
making it a rather involved function of the projected density field. Because of
this difficulty, an approximation that is commonly employed consists in
replacing the reduced shear by the shear in such a construction neglecting
therefore non-linear effects. We were precisely able to quantify how this
approximation affects the $\hat{M}_{ap}$ statistical properties. In particular
we derive the corrective term for the skewness of the $\hat{M}_{ap}$ and
reconstruct its one-point PDF.
"
21611,"Band Structure, Band Offsets, Substitutional Doping, and Schottky Barriers in InSe","  We present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure of the layered
semiconductor InSe using density functional theory. We calculate the band
structure of the monolayer and bulk material with the band gap corrected using
hybrid functionals. The band gap of the monolayer is 2.4 eV. The band edge
states are surprising isotropic. The electron affinities and band offsets are
then calculated for heterostructures as would be used in tunnel field effect
transistors (TFETs). The ionization potential of InSe is quite large, similar
to that of HfSe2 or SnSe2, and so InSe is suitable to act as the drain in the
TFET. The intrinsic defects are then calculated. For Se-rich layers, the Se
adatom is the lowest energy defect, whereas for In-rich layers, the In adatom
is most stable for Fermi energies across most of the gap. Both substitutional
donors and acceptors are calculated to be shallow, and not reconstructed.
Finally, the Schottky barriers of metals are found to be strongly pinned, with
the Fermi level pinned by metal induced gap states about 0.5 eV above the
valence band edge.
"
21612,Scalable on-chip quantum state tomography,"  Quantum information systems are on a path to vastly exceed the complexity of
any classical device. The number of entangled qubits in quantum devices is
rapidly increasing and the information required to fully describe these systems
scales exponentially with qubit number. This scaling is the key benefit of
quantum systems, however it also presents a severe challenge. To characterize
such systems typically requires an exponentially long sequence of different
measurements, becoming highly resource demanding for large numbers of qubits.
Here we propose a novel and scalable method to characterize quantum systems,
where the complexity of the measurement process only scales linearly with the
number of qubits. We experimentally demonstrate an integrated photonic chip
capable of measuring two- and three-photon quantum states with reconstruction
fidelity of 99.67%.
"
21613,Graph Partition Neural Networks for Semi-Supervised Classification,"  We present graph partition neural networks (GPNN), an extension of graph
neural networks (GNNs) able to handle extremely large graphs. GPNNs alternate
between locally propagating information between nodes in small subgraphs and
globally propagating information between the subgraphs. To efficiently
partition graphs, we experiment with several partitioning algorithms and also
propose a novel variant for fast processing of large scale graphs. We
extensively test our model on a variety of semi-supervised node classification
tasks. Experimental results indicate that GPNNs are either superior or
comparable to state-of-the-art methods on a wide variety of datasets for
graph-based semi-supervised classification. We also show that GPNNs can achieve
similar performance as standard GNNs with fewer propagation steps.
"
21614,Nonparametric competing risks analysis using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART),"  Many time-to-event studies are complicated by the presence of competing
risks. Such data are often analyzed using Cox models for the cause specific
hazard function or Fine-Gray models for the subdistribution hazard. In practice
regression relationships in competing risks data with either strategy are often
complex and may include nonlinear functions of covariates, interactions,
high-dimensional parameter spaces and nonproportional cause specific or
subdistribution hazards. Model misspecification can lead to poor predictive
performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to flexible
prediction modeling of competing risks data using Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART). We study the simulation performance in two-sample scenarios as
well as a complex regression setting, and benchmark its performance against
standard regression techniques as well as random survival forests. We
illustrate the use of the proposed method on a recently published study of
patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
"
21615,Performance Bounds For Co-/Sparse Box Constrained Signal Recovery,"  The recovery of structured signals from a few linear measurements is a
central point in both compressed sensing (CS) and discrete tomography. In CS
the signal structure is described by means of a low complexity model e.g.
co-/sparsity. The CS theory shows that any signal/image can be undersampled at
a rate dependent on its intrinsic complexity. Moreover, in such undersampling
regimes, the signal can be recovered by sparsity promoting convex
regularization like $\ell_1$- or total variation (TV-) minimization. Precise
relations between many low complexity measures and the sufficient number of
random measurements are known for many sparsity promoting norms. However, a
precise estimate of the undersampling rate for the TV seminorm is still
lacking. We address this issue by: a) providing dual certificates testing
uniqueness of a given cosparse signal with bounded signal values, b)
approximating the undersampling rates via the statistical dimension of the TV
descent cone and c) showing empirically that the provided rates also hold for
tomographic measurements.
"
21616,On the proper treatment of improper distributions,"  The axiomatic foundation of probability theory presented by Kolmogorov has
been the basis of modern theory for probability and statistics. In certain
applications it is, however, necessary or convenient to allow improper
(unbounded) distributions, which is often done without a theoretical
foundation. The paper reviews a recent theory which includes improper
distributions, and which is related to Renyi's theory of conditional
probability spaces. It is in particular demonstrated how the theory leads to
simple explanations of apparent paradoxes known from the Bayesian literature.
Several examples from statistical practice with improper distributions are
discussed in light of the given theoretical results, which also include a
recent theory of convergence of proper distributions to improper ones.
"
21617,Traces on reduced group C*-algebras,"  In this short note we prove that the reduced group C*-algebra of a locally
compact group admits a non-zero trace if and only if the amenable radical of
the group is open. This completely answers a question raised by Forrest, Spronk
and Wiersma.
"
21618,Rate of Convergence of General Phase Field Equations towards their Homogenized Limit,"  Over the last few decades, phase-field equations have found increasing
applicability in a wide range of mathematical-scientific fields (e.g. geometric
PDEs and mean curvature flow, materials science for the study of phase
transitions) but also engineering ones (e.g. as a computational tool in
chemical engineering for interfacial flow studies). Here, we focus on
phase-field equations in strongly heterogeneous materials with perforations
such as porous media. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first
derivation of error estimates for fourth order, homogenized, and nonlinear
evolution equations. Our fourth order problem induces a slightly lower
convergence rate, i.e., $\epsilon^{1/4}$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the
material's specific heterogeneity, than established for second-order elliptic
problems (e.g. \cite{Zhikov2006}) for the error between the effective
macroscopic solution of the (new) upscaled formulation and the solution of the
microscopic phase field problem. We hope that our study will motivate new
modelling, analytic, and computational perspectives for interfacial transport
and phase transformations in strongly heterogeneous environments.
"
21619,Spin-wave excitations in the SDW state of iron pnictides: a comparison between the roles of interaction parameters,"  We investigate the role of Hund's coupling in the spin-wave excitations of
the ($\pi, 0$) ordered magnetic state within a five-orbital tight-binding model
for iron pnictides. To differentiate between the roles of intraorbital Coulomb
interaction and Hund's coupling, we focus on the self-consistently obtained
mean-field SDW state with a fixed magnetic moment obtained by using different
sets of interaction parameters. We find that the Hund's coupling is crucial for
the description of various experimentally observed characteristics of the
spin-wave excitations including the anisotropy, energy-dependent behavior, and
spin-wave spectral weight distribution.
"
21620,Artificial Neural Networks that Learn to Satisfy Logic Constraints,"  Logic-based problems such as planning, theorem proving, or puzzles, typically
involve combinatoric search and structured knowledge representation. Artificial
neural networks are very successful statistical learners, however, for many
years, they have been criticized for their weaknesses in representing and in
processing complex structured knowledge which is crucial for combinatoric
search and symbol manipulation. Two neural architectures are presented, which
can encode structured relational knowledge in neural activation, and store
bounded First Order Logic constraints in connection weights. Both architectures
learn to search for a solution that satisfies the constraints. Learning is done
by unsupervised practicing on problem instances from the same domain, in a way
that improves the network-solving speed. No teacher exists to provide answers
for the problem instances of the training and test sets. However, the domain
constraints are provided as prior knowledge to a loss function that measures
the degree of constraint violations. Iterations of activation calculation and
learning are executed until a solution that maximally satisfies the constraints
emerges on the output units. As a test case, block-world planning problems are
used to train networks that learn to plan in that domain, but the techniques
proposed could be used more generally as in integrating prior symbolic
knowledge with statistical learning
"
21621,Evaluating gender portrayal in Bangladeshi TV,"  Computer Vision and machine learning methods were previously used to reveal
screen presence of genders in TV and movies. In this work, using head pose,
gender detection, and skin color estimation techniques, we demonstrate that the
gender disparity in TV in a South Asian country such as Bangladesh exhibits
unique characteristics and is sometimes counter-intuitive to popular
perception. We demonstrate a noticeable discrepancy in female screen presence
in Bangladeshi TV advertisements and political talk shows. Further, contrary to
popular hypotheses, we demonstrate that lighter-toned skin colors are less
prevalent than darker complexions, and additionally, quantifiable body language
markers do not provide conclusive insights about gender dynamics. Overall,
these gender portrayal parameters reveal the different layers of onscreen
gender politics and can help direct incentives to address existing disparities
in a nuanced and targeted manner.
"
21622,A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning,"  In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value
distribution: the distribution of the random return received by a reinforcement
learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement
learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there
is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far
it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware
behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and
control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the
latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm
which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value
distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the
Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and
anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in
approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and
empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution
impacts learning in the approximate setting.
"
21623,Computing Individual Risks based on Family History in Genetic Disease in the Presence of Competing Risks,"  When considering a genetic disease with variable age at onset (ex: diabetes ,
familial amyloid neuropathy, cancers, etc.), computing the individual risk of
the disease based on family history (FH) is of critical interest both for
clinicians and patients. Such a risk is very challenging to compute because: 1)
the genotype X of the individual of interest is in general unknown; 2) the
posterior distribution P(X|FH, T > t) changes with t (T is the age at disease
onset for the targeted individual); 3) the competing risk of death is not
negligible. In this work, we present a modeling of this problem using a
Bayesian network mixed with (right-censored) survival outcomes where hazard
rates only depend on the genotype of each individual. We explain how belief
propagation can be used to obtain posterior distribution of genotypes given the
FH, and how to obtain a time-dependent posterior hazard rate for any individual
in the pedigree. Finally, we use this posterior hazard rate to compute
individual risk, with or without the competing risk of death. Our method is
illustrated using the Claus-Easton model for breast cancer (BC). This model
assumes an autosomal dominant genetic risk factor such as non-carriers
(genotype 00) have a BC hazard rate $\lambda$ 0 (t) while carriers (genotypes
01, 10 and 11) have a (much greater) hazard rate $\lambda$ 1 (t). Both hazard
rates are assumed to be piecewise constant with known values (cuts at 20, 30,.
.. , 80 years). The competing risk of death is derived from the national French
registry.
"
21624,The Impact of Feature Selection on Predicting the Number of Bugs,"  Bug prediction is the process of training a machine learning model on
software metrics and fault information to predict bugs in software entities.
While feature selection is an important step in building a robust prediction
model, there is insufficient evidence about its impact on predicting the number
of bugs in software systems. We study the impact of both correlation-based
feature selection (CFS) filter methods and wrapper feature selection methods on
five widely-used prediction models and demonstrate how these models perform
with or without feature selection to predict the number of bugs in five
different open source Java software systems. Our results show that wrappers
outperform the CFS filter; they improve prediction accuracy by up to 33% while
eliminating more than half of the features. We also observe that though the
same feature selection method chooses different feature subsets in different
projects, this subset always contains a mix of source code and change metrics.
"
21625,Aligned Image-Word Representations Improve Inductive Transfer Across Vision-Language Tasks,"  An important goal of computer vision is to build systems that learn visual
representations over time that can be applied to many tasks. In this paper, we
investigate a vision-language embedding as a core representation and show that
it leads to better cross-task transfer than standard multi-task learning. In
particular, the task of visual recognition is aligned to the task of visual
question answering by forcing each to use the same word-region embeddings. We
show this leads to greater inductive transfer from recognition to VQA than
standard multitask learning. Visual recognition also improves, especially for
categories that have relatively few recognition training labels but appear
often in the VQA setting. Thus, our paper takes a small step towards creating
more general vision systems by showing the benefit of interpretable, flexible,

21626,On the Dynamical Stability and Instability of Parker Problem,"  We investigate a perturbation problem for the three-dimensional compressible
isentropic viscous magnetohydrodynamic system with zero resistivity in the
presence of a modified gravitational force in a vertical strip domain in which
the velocity of the fluid is non-slip on the boundary, and focus on the
stabilizing effect of the (equilibrium) magnetic field through the non-slip
boundary condition. We show that there is a discriminant $\Xi$, depending on
the known physical parameters, for the stability/instability of the
perturbation problem. More precisely, if $\Xi<0$, then the perturbation problem
is unstable, i.e., the Parker instability occurs, while if $\Xi>0$ and the
initial perturbation satisfies some relations, then there exists a global
(perturbation) solution which decays algebraically to zero in time, i.e., the
Parker instability does not happen. The stability results in this paper reveal
the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field through the non-slip boundary
condition and the importance of boundary conditions upon the Parker
instability, and demonstrate that a sufficiently strong magnetic field can
prevent the Parker instability from occurring. In addition, based on the
instability results, we further rigorously verify the Parker instability under
Schwarzschild's or Tserkovnikov's instability conditions in the sense of
Hadamard for a horizontally periodic domain.
"
21627,Characterizing Transgender Health Issues in Twitter,"  Although there are millions of transgender people in the world, a lack of
information exists about their health issues. This issue has consequences for
the medical field, which only has a nascent understanding of how to identify
and meet this population's health-related needs. Social media sites like
Twitter provide new opportunities for transgender people to overcome these
barriers by sharing their personal health experiences. Our research employs a
computational framework to collect tweets from self-identified transgender
users, detect those that are health-related, and identify their information
needs. This framework is significant because it provides a macro-scale
perspective on an issue that lacks investigation at national or demographic
levels. Our findings identified 54 distinct health-related topics that we
grouped into 7 broader categories. Further, we found both linguistic and
topical differences in the health-related information shared by transgender men
(TM) as com-pared to transgender women (TW). These findings can help inform
medical and policy-based strategies for health interventions within transgender
communities. Also, our proposed approach can inform the development of
computational strategies to identify the health-related information needs of
other marginalized populations.

21628,CR-Analogue of Siu-$\partial\bar{\partial}$-formula and Applications to Rigidity problem for pseudo-Hermitian harmonic maps,"  We give several versions of Siu's $\partial\bar{\partial}$-formula for maps
from a strictly pseudoconvex pseudo-Hermitian manifold $(M^{2m+1}, \theta)$
into a Kähler manifold $(N^n, g)$. We also define and study the notion of
pseudo-Hermitian harmonicity for maps from $M$ into $N$. In particular, we
prove a CR version of Siu Rigidity Theorem for pseudo-Hermitian harmonic maps
from a pseudo-Hermitian manifold with vanishing Webster torsion into a Kähler
manifold having strongly negative curvature.
"
21629,Speculations on homological mirror symmetry for hypersurfaces in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$,"  Given an algebraic hypersurface $H=f^{-1}(0)$ in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$,
homological mirror symmetry relates the wrapped Fukaya category of $H$ to the
derived category of singularities of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model. We
propose an enriched version of this picture which also features the wrapped
Fukaya category of the complement $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n\setminus H$ and the
Fukaya-Seidel category of the Landau-Ginzburg model $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n,f)$. We
illustrate our speculations on simple examples, and sketch a proof of
homological mirror symmetry for higher-dimensional pairs of pants.
"
21630,Constant Step Size Stochastic Gradient Descent for Probabilistic Modeling,"  Stochastic gradient methods enable learning probabilistic models from large
amounts of data. While large step-sizes (learning rates) have shown to be best
for least-squares (e.g., Gaussian noise) once combined with parameter
averaging, these are not leading to convergent algorithms in general. In this
paper, we consider generalized linear models, that is, conditional models based
on exponential families. We propose averaging moment parameters instead of
natural parameters for constant-step-size stochastic gradient descent. For
finite-dimensional models, we show that this can sometimes (and surprisingly)
lead to better predictions than the best linear model. For infinite-dimensional
models, we show that it always converges to optimal predictions, while
averaging natural parameters never does. We illustrate our findings with
simulations on synthetic data and classical benchmarks with many observations.
"
21631,Virtual and welded periods of classical knots,"  We show that any virtual or welded period of a classical knot $K$ can be
realized as a classical period. A direct consequence is that a classical knot
admits only finitely many virtual or welded periods.
"
21632,Optimal hybrid block bootstrap for sample quantiles under weak dependence,"  We establish a general theory of optimality for block bootstrap distribution
estimation for sample quantiles under a mild strong mixing assumption. In
contrast to existing results, we study the block bootstrap for varying numbers
of blocks. This corresponds to a hybrid between the subsampling bootstrap and
the moving block bootstrap (MBB), in which the number of blocks is somewhere
between 1 and the ratio of sample size to block length. Our main theorem
determines the optimal choice of the number of blocks and block length to
achieve the best possible convergence rate for the block bootstrap distribution
estimator for sample quantiles. As part of our analysis, we also prove an
important lemma which gives the convergence rate of the block bootstrap
distribution estimator, with implications even for the smooth function model.
We propose an intuitive procedure for empirical selection of the optimal number
and length of blocks. Relevant examples are presented which illustrate the
benefits of optimally choosing the number of blocks.
"
21633,Modeling Popularity in Asynchronous Social Media Streams with Recurrent Neural Networks,"  Understanding and predicting the popularity of online items is an important
open problem in social media analysis. Considerable progress has been made
recently in data-driven predictions, and in linking popularity to external
promotions. However, the existing methods typically focus on a single source of
external influence, whereas for many types of online content such as YouTube
videos or news articles, attention is driven by multiple heterogeneous sources
simultaneously - e.g. microblogs or traditional media coverage. Here, we
propose RNN-MAS, a recurrent neural network for modeling asynchronous streams.
It is a sequence generator that connects multiple streams of different
granularity via joint inference. We show RNN-MAS not only to outperform the
current state-of-the-art Youtube popularity prediction system by 17%, but also
to capture complex dynamics, such as seasonal trends of unseen influence. We
define two new metrics: promotion score quantifies the gain in popularity from
one unit of promotion for a Youtube video; the loudness level captures the
effects of a particular user tweeting about the video. We use the loudness
level to compare the effects of a video being promoted by a single
highly-followed user (in the top 1% most followed users) against being promoted
by a group of mid-followed users. We find that results depend on the type of
content being promoted: superusers are more successful in promoting Howto and
Gaming videos, whereas the cohort of regular users are more influential for
Activism videos. This work provides more accurate and explainable popularity
predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers
to allocate resources for promotion campaigns.
"
21634,A moduli stack of tropical curves,"  We contribute to the foundations of tropical geometry with a view towards
formulating tropical moduli problems, and with the moduli space of curves as
our main example. We propose a moduli functor for the moduli space of curves
and show that it is representable by a geometric stack over the category of
rational polyhedral cones. In this framework the natural forgetful morphisms
between moduli spaces of curves with marked points function as universal
curves. Our approach to tropical geometry permits tropical moduli
problems---moduli of curves or otherwise---to be extended to logarithmic
schemes. We use this to construct a smooth tropicalization morphism from the
moduli space of algebraic curves to the moduli space of tropical curves, and we
show that this morphism commutes with all of the tautological morphisms.
"
21635,Kernel entropy estimation for linear processes,"  Let $\{X_n: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ be a linear process with bounded probability
density function $f(x)$. We study the estimation of the quadratic functional
$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f^2(x)\, dx$. With a Fourier transform on the kernel
function and the projection method, it is shown that, under certain mild
conditions, the estimator \[ \frac{2}{n(n-1)h_n} \sum_{1\le i<j\le
n}K\left(\frac{X_i-X_j}{h_n}\right) \] has similar asymptotical properties as
the i.i.d. case studied in Giné and Nickl (2008) if the linear process
$\{X_n: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ has the defined short range dependence. We also
provide an application to $L^2_2$ divergence and the extension to multivariate
linear processes. The simulation study for linear processes with Gaussian and
$\alpha$-stable innovations confirms our theoretical results. As an
illustration, we estimate the $L^2_2$ divergences among the density functions
of average annual river flows for four rivers and obtain promising results.
"
21636,Non-colocated Time-Reversal MUSIC: High-SNR Distribution of Null Spectrum,"  We derive the asymptotic distribution of the null spectrum of the well-known
Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) in its computational Time-Reversal (TR)
form. The result pertains to a single-frequency non-colocated multistatic
scenario and several TR-MUSIC variants are here investigated. The analysis
builds upon the 1st-order perturbation of the singular value decomposition and
allows a simple characterization of null-spectrum moments (up to the 2nd
order). This enables a comparison in terms of spectrums stability. Finally, a
numerical analysis is provided to confirm the theoretical findings.
"
21637,"Google Cardboard Dates Augmented Reality : Issues, Challenges and Future Opportunities","  The Google's frugal Cardboard solution for immersive Virtual Reality
experiences has come a long way in the VR market. The Google Cardboard VR
applications will support us in the fields such as education, virtual tourism,
entertainment, gaming, design etc. Recently, Qualcomm's Vuforia SDK has
introduced support for developing mixed reality applications for Google
Cardboard which can combine Virtual and Augmented Reality to develop exciting
and immersive experiences. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of
Google Cardboard for AR and also highlight its technical and subjective
limitations by conducting a feasibility study through the inspection of a
Desktop computer use-case. Additionally, we recommend the future avenues for
the Google Cardboard in AR. This work also serves as a guide for Android/iOS
developers as there are no published scholarly articles or well documented
studies exclusively on Google Cardboard with both user and developer's
experience captured at one place.
"
21638,Multiplayer bandits without observing collision information,"  We study multiplayer stochastic multi-armed bandit problems in which the
players cannot communicate, and if two or more players pull the same arm, a
collision occurs and the involved players receive zero reward. We consider two
feedback models: a model in which the players can observe whether a collision
has occurred, and a more difficult setup when no collision information is
available. We give the first theoretical guarantees for the second model: an
algorithm with a logarithmic regret, and an algorithm with a square-root regret
type that does not depend on the gaps between the means. For the first model,
we give the first square-root regret bounds that do not depend on the gaps.
Building on these ideas, we also give an algorithm for reaching approximate
Nash equilibria quickly in stochastic anti-coordination games.
"
21639,Development of pediatric myeloid leukemia may be related to the repeatedbone-remodeling during bone-growth,"  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are two major
formsof leukemia developed from myeloid cells (MCs). To understand why AML and
CML occurin children, we analyzed the causes and the mechanism of cell
transformation of a MC. I. Forthe MCs in marrow cavity, repeated
bone-remodeling during bone-growth may be a source ofcell injuries. II. As a
type of blood cell, a MC may have higher survivability from DNAchanges and
require obtaining fewer cancerous properties for cell transformation than a
tissuecell. III. Point DNA mutations (PDMs) and chromosome changes (CCs) are
the two majortypes of DNA changes. CCs have three subtypes by effects on a
cell: great effect CCs(GECCs), mild-effect CCs (MECCs), and intermediate-effect
CCs (IECCs). A GECC affectsone or more genes and can alone trigger cell
transformation. PDMs/MECCs are mostly mildand can accumulate in cells. Some of
the PDMs/MECCs contribute to cell transformation. AnIECC affects one or more
genes and participates in cell transformation. IV. Based on II andIII, we
hypothesize that a MC may have two pathways on transformation: a slow and
anaccelerated. Slow pathway is driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs.
Accelerated pathwayis driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). A
transformation via slow pathwayoccurs at old age; whereas that via accelerated
pathway occurs at any age. Thus, CML andpediatric AML may develop via
accelerated pathway, and adult AML may develop via bothpathways. In conclusion,
pediatric AML and CML may develop as a result of transformationof a MC via
accelerated pathway; and repeated bone-remodeling for bone-growth may be
atrigger for the transformation of a MC in a child.
"
21640,Gradient Descent for Spiking Neural Networks,"  Much of studies on neural computation are based on network models of static
neurons that produce analog output, despite the fact that information
processing in the brain is predominantly carried out by dynamic neurons that
produce discrete pulses called spikes. Research in spike-based computation has
been impeded by the lack of efficient supervised learning algorithm for spiking
networks. Here, we present a gradient descent method for optimizing spiking
network models by introducing a differentiable formulation of spiking networks
and deriving the exact gradient calculation. For demonstration, we trained
recurrent spiking networks on two dynamic tasks: one that requires optimizing
fast (~millisecond) spike-based interactions for efficient encoding of
information, and a delayed memory XOR task over extended duration (~second).
The results show that our method indeed optimizes the spiking network dynamics
on the time scale of individual spikes as well as behavioral time scales. In
conclusion, our result offers a general purpose supervised learning algorithm
for spiking neural networks, thus advancing further investigations on
spike-based computation.
"
21641,Implicit and Implicit-Explicit Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta Methods with High Linear Order,"  When evolving in time the solution of a hyperbolic partial differential
equation, it is often desirable to use high order strong stability preserving
(SSP) time discretizations. These time discretizations preserve the
monotonicity properties satisfied by the spatial discretization when coupled
with the first order forward Euler, under a certain time-step restriction.
While the allowable time-step depends on both the spatial and temporal
discretizations, the contribution of the temporal discretization can be
isolated by taking the ratio of the allowable time-step of the high order
method to the forward Euler time-step. This ratio is called the strong
stability coefficient. The search for high order strong stability time-stepping
methods with high order and large allowable time-step had been an active area
of research. It is known that implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods exist only up to
sixth order. However, if we restrict ourselves to solving only linear
autonomous problems, the order conditions simplify and we can find implicit SSP
Runge-Kutta methods of any linear order. In the current work we aim to find
very high linear order implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods that are optimal in
terms of allowable time-step. Next, we formulate an optimization problem for
implicit-explicit (IMEX) SSP Runge-Kutta methods and find implicit methods with
large linear stability regions that pair with known explicit SSP Runge-Kutta
methods of orders plin=3,4,6 as well as optimized IMEX SSP Runge-Kutta pairs
that have high linear order and nonlinear orders p=2,3,4. These methods are
then tested on sample problems to verify order of convergence and to
demonstrate the sharpness of the SSP coefficient and the typical behavior of
these methods on test problems.
"
21642,Kinetic energy of a trapped Fermi gas at finite temperature,"  We study the statistics of the kinetic (or equivalently potential) energy for
$N$ non-interacting fermions in a $1d$ harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$, at
finite temperature $T$. Remarkably, we find an exact solution for the full
distribution of the kinetic energy, at any temperature $T$ and for any $N$,
using a non-trivial mapping to an integrable Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model.
As a function of temperature $T$, and for large $N$, we identify: (i) a quantum
regime, for $T \sim \hbar \omega$, where quantum fluctuations dominate and (ii)
a thermal regime, for $T \sim N \hbar \omega$, governed by thermal
fluctuations. We show how the mean, the variance as well as the large deviation
function associated with the distribution of the kinetic energy cross over from
the quantum to the thermal regime as temperature increases.
"
21643,Multilingual Multi-modal Embeddings for Natural Language Processing,"  We propose a novel discriminative model that learns embeddings from
multilingual and multi-modal data, meaning that our model can take advantage of
images and descriptions in multiple languages to improve embedding quality. To
that end, we introduce a modification of a pairwise contrastive estimation
optimisation function as our training objective. We evaluate our embeddings on
an image-sentence ranking (ISR), a semantic textual similarity (STS), and a
neural machine translation (NMT) task. We find that the additional multilingual
signals lead to improvements on both the ISR and STS tasks, and the
discriminative cost can also be used in re-ranking $n$-best lists produced by
NMT models, yielding strong improvements.
"
21644,Deep Adaptive Feature Embedding with Local Sample Distributions for Person Re-identification,"  Person re-identification (re-id) aims to match pedestrians observed by
disjoint camera views. It attracts increasing attention in computer vision due
to its importance to surveillance system. To combat the major challenge of
cross-view visual variations, deep embedding approaches are proposed by
learning a compact feature space from images such that the Euclidean distances
correspond to their cross-view similarity metric. However, the global Euclidean
distance cannot faithfully characterize the ideal similarity in a complex
visual feature space because features of pedestrian images exhibit unknown
distributions due to large variations in poses, illumination and occlusion.
Moreover, intra-personal training samples within a local range are robust to
guide deep embedding against uncontrolled variations, which however, cannot be
captured by a global Euclidean distance. In this paper, we study the problem of
person re-id by proposing a novel sampling to mine suitable \textit{positives}
(i.e. intra-class) within a local range to improve the deep embedding in the
context of large intra-class variations. Our method is capable of learning a
deep similarity metric adaptive to local sample structure by minimizing each
sample's local distances while propagating through the relationship between
samples to attain the whole intra-class minimization. To this end, a novel
objective function is proposed to jointly optimize similarity metric learning,
local positive mining and robust deep embedding. This yields local
discriminations by selecting local-ranged positive samples, and the learned
features are robust to dramatic intra-class variations. Experiments on
benchmarks show state-of-the-art results achieved by our method.
"
21645,Frequency violations from random disturbances: an MCMC approach,"  The frequency stability of power systems is increasingly challenged by
various types of disturbances. In particular, the increasing penetration of
renewable energy sources is increasing the variability of power generation and
at the same time reducing system inertia against disturbances. In this paper we
are particularly interested in understanding how rate of change of frequency
(RoCoF) violations could arise from unusually large power disturbances. We
devise a novel specialization, named ghost sampling, of the Metropolis-Hastings
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that is tailored to efficiently sample rare
power disturbances leading to nodal frequency violations. Generating a
representative random sample addresses important statistical questions such as
""which generator is most likely to be disconnected due to a RoCoF violation?""
or ""what is the probability of having simultaneous RoCoF violations, given that
a violation occurs?"" Our method can perform conditional sampling from any joint
distribution of power disturbances including, for instance, correlated and
non-Gaussian disturbances, features which have both been recently shown to be
significant in security analyses.
"
21646,"A randomized, efficient algorithm for 3SAT","  In this paper I present a 3SAT algorithm based on the randomized algorithm of
Papadimitriou from 1991, and Schoning from 1991. We also present strong
arguments that this algorithm finds a solution (if it exists) for a 3SAT
problem with high probability in polynomial time.
"
21647,Photogravimagnetic assists of light sails: a mixed blessing for Breakthrough Starshot?,"  Upon entering a star system, light sails are subject to both gravitational
forces and radiation pressure, and can use both in concert to modify their
trajectory. Moreover, stars possess significant magnetic fields, and if the
sail is in any way charged, it will feel the Lorentz force also.
We investigate the dynamics of so-called ""photogravimagnetic assists"" of
sailcraft around $\alpha$ Centauri A, a potential first destination en route to
Proxima Centauri (the goal of the Breakthrough Starshot program). We find that
a 10m$^2$ sail with a charge-to-mass-ratio of around 10 $\mu$C/g or higher will
need to take account of magnetic field effects during orbital maneouvres. The
magnetic field can provide an extra source of deceleration and deflection, and
allow capture onto closer orbits around a target star.
However, flipping the sign of the sailcraft's charge can radically change
resulting trajectories, resulting in complex loop-de-loops around magnetic
field lines and essentially random ejection from the star system. Even on
well-behaved trajectories, the field can generate off-axis deflections at
$\alpha$ Centauri that, while minor, can result in very poor targetting of the
final destination (Proxima) post-assist.
Fortunately for Breakthrough Starshot, nanosails are less prone to charging
en route than their heavier counterparts, but can still accrue relatively high
charge at both the origin and destination, when travelling at low speeds.
Photogravimagnetic assists are highly non-trivial, and require careful course
correction to mitigate against unwanted changes in trajectory.
"
21648,Voice Conversion Using Sequence-to-Sequence Learning of Context Posterior Probabilities,"  Voice conversion (VC) using sequence-to-sequence learning of context
posterior probabilities is proposed. Conventional VC using shared context
posterior probabilities predicts target speech parameters from the context
posterior probabilities estimated from the source speech parameters. Although
conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert
speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in
the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are
directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume
that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose
sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior
probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length
transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further,
we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to
conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates
posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech
parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the
proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the conventional VC.
"
21649,Provable Self-Representation Based Outlier Detection in a Union of Subspaces,"  Many computer vision tasks involve processing large amounts of data
contaminated by outliers, which need to be detected and rejected. While outlier
detection methods based on robust statistics have existed for decades, only
recently have methods based on sparse and low-rank representation been
developed along with guarantees of correct outlier detection when the inliers
lie in one or more low-dimensional subspaces. This paper proposes a new outlier
detection method that combines tools from sparse representation with random
walks on a graph. By exploiting the property that data points can be expressed
as sparse linear combinations of each other, we obtain an asymmetric affinity
matrix among data points, which we use to construct a weighted directed graph.
By defining a suitable Markov Chain from this graph, we establish a connection
between inliers/outliers and essential/inessential states of the Markov chain,
which allows us to detect outliers by using random walks. We provide a
theoretical analysis that justifies the correctness of our method under
geometric and connectivity assumptions. Experimental results on image databases
demonstrate its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art sparse and
low-rank outlier detection methods.
"
21650,Micro and Macro Pedestrian Dynamics in Counterflow: the Impact of Social Groups,"  Although it is widely recognised that the presence of groups influences
microscopic and aggregated pedestrian dynamics, a precise characterisation of
the phenomenon still calls for evidences and insights. The present paper
describes micro and macro level original analyses on data characterising
pedestrian behaviour in presence of counter-flows and grouping, in particular
dyads, acquired through controlled experiments. Results suggest that the
presence of dyads and their tendency to walk in a line-abreast formation
influences the formation of lanes and, in turn, aggregated observables, such as
overall specific flow.
"
21651,Ensemble Kalman Filtering for Online Gaussian Process Regression and Learning,"  Gaussian process regression is a machine learning approach which has been
shown its power for estimation of unknown functions. However, Gaussian
processes suffer from high computational complexity, as in a basic form they
scale cubically with the number of observations. Several approaches based on
inducing points were proposed to handle this problem in a static context. These
methods though face challenges with real-time tasks and when the data is
received sequentially over time. In this paper, a novel online algorithm for
training sparse Gaussian process models is presented. It treats the mean and
hyperparameters of the Gaussian process as the state and parameters of the
ensemble Kalman filter, respectively. The online evaluation of the parameters
and the state is performed on new upcoming samples of data. This procedure
iteratively improves the accuracy of parameter estimates. The ensemble Kalman
filter reduces the computational complexity required to obtain predictions with
Gaussian processes preserving the accuracy level of these predictions. The
performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the synthetic dataset and
real large dataset of UK house prices.
"
21652,Damage detection in a unidimensional truss using the firefly optimization algorithm and finite elements,"  In this paper, we investigate the damage detection of structures seen as an
optimization problem, using modal characterization to evaluate the dynamic
response of the structure given a damage model. We implemented the firefly
optimization algorithm with a simple numerical damage model to assess the
performance of the method and its advantages for structural health monitoring
(SHM). We show some implementation details and discuss the obtained results.
"
21653,Surface-sampled simulations of turbulent flow at high Reynolds number,"  A new approach to turbulence simulation, based on a combination of large-eddy
simulation (LES) for the whole flow and an array of non-space-filling
quasi-direct numerical simulations (QDNS), which sample the response of
near-wall turbulence to large-scale forcing, is proposed and evaluated. The
technique overcomes some of the cost limitations of turbulence simulation,
since the main flow is treated with a coarse-grid LES, with the equivalent of
wall functions supplied by the near-wall sampled QDNS. Two cases are tested, at
friction Reynolds number Re$_\tau$=4200 and 20,000. The total grid node count
for the first case is less than half a million and less than two million for
the second case, with the calculations only requiring a desktop computer. A
good agreement with published DNS is found at Re$_\tau$=4200, both in terms of
the mean velocity profile and the streamwise velocity fluctuation statistics,
which correctly show a substantial increase in near-wall turbulence levels due
to a modulation of near-wall streaks by large-scale structures. The trend
continues at Re$_\tau$=20,000, in agreement with experiment, which represents
one of the major achievements of the new approach. A number of detailed aspects
of the model, including numerical resolution, LES-QDNS coupling strategy and
sub-grid model are explored. A low level of grid sensitivity is demonstrated
for both the QDNS and LES aspects. Since the method does not assume a law of
the wall, it can in principle be applied to flows that are out of equilibrium.
"
21654,Moving Block and Tapered Block Bootstrap for Functional Time Series with an Application to the K-Sample Mean Problem,"  We consider infinite-dimensional Hilbert space-valued random variables that
are assumed to be temporal dependent in a broad sense. We prove a central limit
theorem for the moving block bootstrap and for the tapered block bootstrap, and
show that these block bootstrap procedures also provide consistent estimators
of the long run covariance operator. Furthermore, we consider block
bootstrap-based procedures for fully functional testing of the equality of mean
functions between several independent functional time series. We establish
validity of the block bootstrap methods in approximating the distribution of
the statistic of interest under the null and show consistency of the block
bootstrap-based tests under the alternative. The finite sample behaviour of the
procedures is investigated by means of simulations. An application to a
real-life dataset is also discussed.
"
21655,"Competing spin density wave, collinear, and helical magnetism in Fe1+xTe","  The Fe1+xTe phase diagram consists of two distinct magnetic structures with
collinear order present at low interstitial iron concentrations and a helical
phase at large values of x with these phases separated by a Lifshitz point. We
use unpolarized single crystal diffraction to confirm the helical phase for
large interstitial iron concentrations and polarized single crystal diffraction
to demonstrate the collinear order for the iron deficient side of the Fe1+xTe
phase diagram. Polarized neutron inelastic scattering show that the
fluctuations associated with this collinear order are predominately transverse
at low energy transfers, consistent with a localized magnetic moment picture.
We then apply neutron inelastic scattering and polarization analysis to
investigate the dynamics and structure near the boundary between collinear and
helical order in the Fe1+xTe phase diagram. We first show that the phase
separating collinear and helical order is characterized by a spin-density wave
with a single propagation wave vector of (~ 0.45, 0, 0.5). We do not observe
harmonics or the presence of a charge density wave. The magnetic fluctuations
associated with this wavevector are different from the collinear phase being
strongly longitudinal in nature and correlated anisotropically in the (H,K)
plane. The excitations preserve the C4 symmetry of the lattice, but display
different widths in momentum along the two tetragonal directions at low energy
transfers. While the low energy excitations and minimal magnetic phase diagram
can be understood in terms of localized interactions, we suggest that the
presence of density wave phase implies the importance of electronic and orbital
properties.
"
21656,Technical Report: Sensor-Based Reactive Symbolic Planning in Partially Known Environments,"  This paper considers the problem of completing assemblies of passive objects
in nonconvex environments, cluttered with convex obstacles of unknown position,
shape and size that satisfy a specific separation assumption. A differential
drive robot equipped with a gripper and a LIDAR sensor, capable of perceiving
its environment only locally, is used to position the passive objects in a
desired configuration. The method combines the virtues of a deliberative
planner generating high-level, symbolic commands, with the formal guarantees of
convergence and obstacle avoidance of a reactive planner that requires little
onboard computation and is used online. The validity of the proposed method is
verified both with formal proofs and numerical simulations.
"
21657,Resonances on regular tree graphs,"  We investigate the distribution of the resonances near spectral thresholds of
Laplace operators on regular tree graphs with $k$-fold branching, $k \geq 1$,
perturbed by nonself-adjoint exponentially decaying potentials. We establish
results on the absence of resonances which in particular involve absence of
discrete spectrum near some sectors of the essential spectrum of the operators.
"
21658,Spectral Methods in the Presence of Discontinuities,"  Spectral methods provide an elegant and efficient way of numerically solving
differential equations of all kinds. For smooth problems, truncation error for
spectral methods vanishes exponentially in the infinity norm and $L_2$-norm.
However, for non-smooth problems, convergence is significantly worse---the
$L_2$-norm of the error for a discontinuous problem will converge at a
sub-linear rate and the infinity norm will not converge at all. We explore and
improve upon a post-processing technique---optimally convergent mollifiers---to
recover exponential convergence from a poorly-converging spectral
reconstruction of non-smooth data. This is an important first step towards
using these techniques for simulations of realistic systems.
"
21659,A Distributed Frank-Wolfe Framework for Learning Low-Rank Matrices with the Trace Norm,"  We consider the problem of learning a high-dimensional but low-rank matrix
from a large-scale dataset distributed over several machines, where
low-rankness is enforced by a convex trace norm constraint. We propose
DFW-Trace, a distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithm which leverages the low-rank
structure of its updates to achieve efficiency in time, memory and
communication usage. The step at the heart of DFW-Trace is solved approximately
using a distributed version of the power method. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the convergence of DFW-Trace, showing that we can ensure sublinear
convergence in expectation to an optimal solution with few power iterations per
epoch. We implement DFW-Trace in the Apache Spark distributed programming
framework and validate the usefulness of our approach on synthetic and real
data, including the ImageNet dataset with high-dimensional features extracted
from a deep neural network.

21660,Stability of the Malvinas Current,"  Deterministic and probabilistic tools from nonlinear dynamics are used to
assess enduring near-surface Lagrangian aspects of the Malvinas Current. The
deterministic tools are applied on a multi-year record of velocities derived
from satellite altimetry data, revealing a resilient cross-stream transport
barrier. This is composed of shearless-parabolic Lagrangian coherent structures
(LCS), which, extracted over sliding time windows along the multi-year
altimetry-derived velocity record, lie in near coincidental position. The
probabilistic tools are applied on a large collection of historical
satellite-tracked drifter trajectories, revealing weakly communicating flow
regions on either side of the altimetry-derived barrier. Shearless-parabolic
LCS are detected for the first time from altimetry data, and their significance
is supported on satellite-derived ocean color data, which reveal shapes that
quite closely resemble the peculiar V shapes, dubbed `chevrons,' that have
recently confirmed the presence of similar LCS in the atmosphere of Jupiter.
Finally, using in-situ velocity and hydrographic data, conditions for symmetric
stability are found to be satisfied, suggesting a duality between Lagrangian
and Eulerian stability for the Malvinas Current.

21661,Probabilistic Mid- and Long-Term Electricity Price Forecasting,"  The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable
energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges
are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price
movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict
electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for
market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very
scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is
mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by
introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly
resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of
future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to
detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we
decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria.
Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve
for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to
give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six
consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand
curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series
of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error
measures.
"
21662,"The infinity Quillen functor, Maurer-Cartan elements and DGL realizations","  We show an alternative construction of the cosimplicial free complete
diferential graded Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{L}_\bullet=\widehat{\mathbb{L}}(s^{-1}\Delta^\bullet)$ based on a
new Lie bracket formulae for Lie polynomials on a general tensor algebra. Based
on it,we prove that for any complete differential graded Lie algebra $L$, its
geometrical realization $\langle
L\rangle=\text{Hom}_{\text{cdgl}}(\mathfrak{L}_\bullet,L)$ is isomorphic to its
nerve $\gamma_\bullet(L)$, a deformation retract of the Getzler-Hinich
realization $\text{MC}(\mathscr{A}_\bullet\widehat{\otimes} L)$.
"
21663,Time Domain Filtering of Resolved Images of Sgr A*,"  The goal of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is to provide spatially
resolved images of Sgr A*, the source associated with the Galactic Center black
hole. Because Sgr A* varies on timescales short compared to an EHT observing
campaign, it is interesting to ask whether variability contains information
about the structure and dynamics of the accretion flow. In this paper, we
introduce ""time-domain filtering"", a technique to filter time fluctuating
images with specific temporal frequency ranges, and demonstrate the power and
usage of the technique by applying it to mock millimeter wavelength images of
Sgr A*. The mock image data is generated from General Relativistic
Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation and general relativistic ray-tracing
method. We show that the variability on each line of sight is tightly
correlated with a typical radius of emission. This is because disk emissivity
fluctuates on a timescale of order the local orbital period. Time-domain
filtered images therefore reflect the model dependent emission radius
distribution, which is not accessible in time-averaged images. We show that, in
principle, filtered data have the power to distinguish between models with
different black hole spins, different disk viewing angles, and different disk
orientations in the sky.
"
21664,HCU400: An Annotated Dataset for Exploring Aural Phenomenology Through Causal Uncertainty,"  The way we perceive a sound depends on many aspects-- its ecological
frequency, acoustic features, typicality, and most notably, its identified
source. In this paper, we present the HCU400: a dataset of 402 sounds ranging
from easily identifiable everyday sounds to intentionally obscured artificial
ones. It aims to lower the barrier for the study of aural phenomenology as the
largest available audio dataset to include an analysis of causal attribution.
Each sample has been annotated with crowd-sourced descriptions, as well as
familiarity, imageability, arousal, and valence ratings. We extend existing
calculations of causal uncertainty, automating and generalizing them with word
embeddings. Upon analysis we find that individuals will provide less polarized
emotion ratings as a sound's source becomes increasingly ambiguous; individual
ratings of familiarity and imageability, on the other hand, diverge as
uncertainty increases despite a clear negative trend on average.
"
21665,Nonlinear Unknown Input Observability: The General Analytic Solution,"  This book provides the analytic solution of a fundamental open problem in
control theory. It provides the general analytic criterion to obtain the state
observability of nonlinear systems in presence of multiple unknown inputs. This
problem, called the Unknown Input Observability problem, was introduced in the
seventies. The analytic criterion is simple and can be easily and automatically
applied to nonlinear systems driven by both known and unknown inputs,
independently of their complexity and type of nonlinearity. Very surprisingly,
the complexity of the overall analytic criterion is comparable to the
complexity of the standard method to check the state observability in the case
without unknown inputs (i.e., the observability rank condition). Given any
nonlinear system characterized by any type of nonlinearity, driven by both
known and unknown inputs, the state observability is obtained by following a
simple systematic procedure (e.g., by the usage of a very simple code that uses
symbolic computation). This is a fundamental practical (and unexpected)
advantage. On the other hand, the analytic derivations and all the proofs
necessary to analytically derive the algorithm and its convergence properties
and to prove their general validity are very complex and they are extensively
based on an ingenious analogy with the theory of General Relativity. In
practice, these derivations largely use Ricci calculus with tensors. The
analytic criterion is illustrated by checking the observability of several
nonlinear systems ranging from planar robotics up to advanced nonlinear
systems. In particular, the last applications are in the framework of
visual-inertial sensor fusion. For this problem, the application of the
analytic criterion provides a remarkable and amazing result, which could have
relevance on the problem of visual-vestibular integration for self-motion
perception in neuroscience.
"
21666,Valley-Polarized Exciton-Polaritons in a Monolayer Semiconductor,"  Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides are two-dimensional direct
bandgap semiconductors with degenerate, but inequivalent, `valleys' in the
electronic structure that can be selectively excited by polarized light.
Coherent superpositions of light and matter, exciton-polaritons, have been
observed when these materials are strongly coupled to photons, but these hybrid
quasiparticles do not harness the valley-sensitive excitations of monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we demonstrate evidence for valley
polarized exciton-polaritons in monolayers of MoS$_2$ embedded in a dielectric
microcavity. Unlike traditional microcavity exciton-polaritons, these
light-matter quasiparticles emit polarized light with spectral Rabi splitting.
The interplay of cavity-modified exciton dynamics and intervalley relaxation in
the high-cooperativity regime causes valley polarized exciton-polaritons to
persist to room temperature, distinct from the vanishing polarization in bare
monolayers. Achieving polarization-sensitive polaritonic devices operating at
room temperature presents a pathway for manipulating novel valley degrees of
freedom in coherent states of light and matter.
"
21667,Identifying Driver Behaviors using Trajectory Features for Vehicle Navigation,"  We present a novel approach to automatically identify driver behaviors from
vehicle trajectories and use them for safe navigation of autonomous vehicles.
We propose a novel set of features that can be easily extracted from car
trajectories. We derive a data-driven mapping between these features and six
driver behaviors using an elaborate web-based user study. We also compute a
summarized score indicating a level of awareness that is needed while driving
next to other vehicles. We also incorporate our algorithm into a vehicle
navigation simulation system and demonstrate its benefits in terms of safer
real-time navigation, while driving next to aggressive or dangerous drivers.
"
21668,Using Global Constraints and Reranking to Improve Cognates Detection,"  Global constraints and reranking have not been used in cognates detection
research to date. We propose methods for using global constraints by performing
rescoring of the score matrices produced by state of the art cognates detection
systems. Using global constraints to perform rescoring is complementary to
state of the art methods for performing cognates detection and results in
significant performance improvements beyond current state of the art
performance on publicly available datasets with different language pairs and
various conditions such as different levels of baseline state of the art
performance and different data size conditions, including with more realistic
large data size conditions than have been evaluated with in the past.
"
21669,"An All-Memristor Deep Spiking Neural Computing System: A Step Towards Realizing the Low Power,Stochastic Brain","  Deep 'Analog Artificial Neural Networks' (ANNs) perform complex
classification problems with remarkably high accuracy. However, they rely on
humongous amount of power to perform the calculations, veiling the accuracy
benefits. The biological brain on the other hand is significantly more powerful
than such networks and consumes orders of magnitude less power, indicating us
about some conceptual mismatch. Given that the biological neurons communicate
using energy efficient trains of spikes, and the behavior is non-deterministic,
incorporating these effects in Deep Artificial Neural Networks may drive us few
steps towards a more realistic neuron. In this work, we propose how the
inherent stochasticity of nano-scale resistive devices can be harnessed to
emulate the functionality of a spiking neuron that can be incorporated in deep
stochastic Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). At the algorithmic level, we propose
how the training can be modified to convert an ANN to an SNN while supporting
the stochastic activation function offered by these devices. We devise circuit
architectures to incorporate stochastic memristive neurons along with
memristive crossbars which perform the functionality of the synaptic weights.
We tested the proposed All Memristor deep stochastic SNN for image
classification and observed only about 1% degradation in accuracy with the ANN
baseline after incorporating the circuit and device related non-idealities. We
witnessed that the network is robust to certain variations and consumes ~ 6.4x
less energy than its CMOS counterpart.
"
21670,Bridge spectra of cables of 2-bridge knots,"  We compute the bridge spectra of cables of 2-bridge knots. We also give some
results about bridge spectra and distance of Montesinos knots.
"
21671,Optimizations of Management Algorithms for Multi-Level Memory Hierarchy,"  In the near future the SCM is predicted to modify the form of new programs,
the access form to storage, and the way that storage devices themselves are
built. Therefore, a combination between the SCM and a designated Memory
Allocation Manager (MAM) that will allow the programmer to manually control the
different memories in the memory hierarchy will be likely to achieve a new
level of performance for memory-aware data structures. Although the manual MAM
seems to be the optimal approach for multi-level memory hierarchy management,
this technique is still very far from being realistic, and the chances that it
would be implemented in current codes using High Performance Computing (HPC)
platforms is quite low. This premise means that the most reasonable way to
introduce the SCM into any usable and popular memory system would be by
implementing an automated version of the MAM using the fundamentals of paging
algorithms, as used for two-level memory hierarchy. Our hypothesis is that
achieving appropriate transferability between memory levels may be possible
using ideas of algorithms employed in current virtual memory systems, and that
the adaptation of those algorithms from a two-level memory hierarchy to an
N-level memory hierarchy is possible. In order to reach the conclusion that our
hypothesis is correct, we investigated various paging algorithms, and found the
ones that could be adapted successfully from two-level memory hierarchy to an
N-level memory hierarchy. We discovered that using an adaptation of the Aging
paging algorithm to an N-level memory hierarchy results in the best
performances in terms of Hit/Miss ratio. In order to verify our hypothesis we
build a simulator called ""DeMemory simulator"" for analyzing our algorithms as
well as for other algorithms that will be devised in the future.
"
21672,Mining Smart Card Data for Travelers' Mini Activities,"  In the context of public transport modeling and simulation, we address the
problem of mismatch between simulated transit trips and observed ones. We point
to the weakness of the current travel demand modeling process; the trips it
generates are over-optimistic and do not reflect the real passenger choices. We
introduce the notion of mini activities the travelers do during the trips; they
can explain the deviation of simulated trips from the observed trips. We
propose to mine the smart card data to extract the mini activities. We develop
a technique to integrate them in the generated trips and learn such an
integration from two available sources, the trip history and trip planner
recommendations. For an input travel demand, we build a Markov chain over the
trip collection and apply the Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm to integrate
mini activities in such a way that the selected characteristics converge to the
desired distributions. We test our method in different settings on the
passenger trip collection of Nancy, France. We report experimental results
demonstrating a very important mismatch reduction.
"
21673,Multiple nonlinear resonances and frequency combs in bottle microresonators,"  We introduce the generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation describing nonlinear
effects in the bottle microresonators. We demonstrate that the nonlinear modes
of these resonators can form multiple coexisting and overlapping nonlinear
resonances and that their instabilities lead to the generation of the low
repetition rate frequency combs.
"
21674,Data-Driven Robust Control for Type 1 Diabetes Under Meal and Exercise Uncertainties,"  We present a fully closed-loop design for an artificial pancreas (AP) which
regulates the delivery of insulin for the control of Type I diabetes. Our AP
controller operates in a fully automated fashion, without requiring any manual
interaction (e.g. in the form of meal announcements) with the patient. A major
obstacle to achieving closed-loop insulin control is the uncertainty in those
aspects of a patient's daily behavior that significantly affect blood glucose,
especially in relation to meals and physical activity. To handle such
uncertainties, we develop a data-driven robust model-predictive control
framework, where we capture a wide range of individual meal and exercise
patterns using uncertainty sets learned from historical data. These sets are
then used in the controller and state estimator to achieve automated, precise,
and personalized insulin therapy. We provide an extensive in silico evaluation
of our robust AP design, demonstrating the potential of this approach, without
explicit meal announcements, to support high carbohydrate disturbances and to
regulate glucose levels in large clusters of virtual patients learned from
population-wide survey data.

21675,"""Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn"": changing the approach of teaching Computer Organization","  Millennials are arriving to university sometimes uncomfortable with the
methods of some courses. Ideas that worked with previous generations of
students begin to fail when digital natives receive paper and pencil as tools.
Courses must update from old paper-based methods to hands-on and computerized
versions. The present work discusses about this update and comments on one
implementation in the course Computer Organization of the Computer Science
curriculum at Universidad de Buenos Aires. It also includes some metrics that
show the effectiveness of the changes in attracting and engaging the digital
generation.
"
21676,Biotechnology and the lifetime of technical civilizations,"  The number of people able to end Earth's technical civilization has
heretofore been small. Emerging dual-use technologies, such as biotechnology,
may give similar power to thousands or millions of individuals. To
quantitatively investigate the ramifications of such a marked shift on the
survival of both terrestrial and extraterrestrial technical civilizations, this
paper presents a two-parameter model for civilizational lifespans, i.e. the
quantity $L$ in Drake's equation for the number of communicating
extraterrestrial civilizations. One parameter characterizes the population
lethality of a civilization's biotechnology and the other characterizes the
civilization's psychosociology. $L$ is demonstrated to be less than the inverse
of the product of these two parameters. Using empiric data from Pubmed to
inform the biotechnology parameter, the model predicts human civilization's
median survival time as decades to centuries, even with optimistic
psychosociological parameter values, thereby positioning biotechnology as a
proximate threat to human civilization. For an ensemble of civilizations having
some median calculated survival time, the model predicts that, after 80 times
that duration, only one in $10^{24}$ civilizations will survive -- a tempo and
degree of winnowing compatible with Hanson's ""Great Filter."" Thus, assuming
that civilizations universally develop advanced biotechnology, before they
become vigorous interstellar colonizers, the model provides a resolution to the
Fermi paradox.
"
21677,Differential Expression Analysis of Dynamical Sequencing Count Data with a Gamma Markov Chain,"  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) to profile temporal changes in living
systems is gaining more attention for deriving better insights into the
underlying biological mechanisms compared to traditional static sequencing
experiments. Nonetheless, the majority of existing statistical tools for
analyzing NGS data lack the capability of exploiting the richer information
embedded in temporal data. Several recent tools have been developed to analyze
such data but they typically impose strict model assumptions, such as
smoothness on gene expression dynamic changes. To capture a broader range of
gene expression dynamic patterns, we develop the gamma Markov negative binomial
(GMNB) model that integrates a gamma Markov chain into a negative binomial
distribution model, allowing flexible temporal variation in NGS count data.
Using Bayes factors, GMNB enables more powerful temporal gene differential
expression analysis across different phenotypes or treatment conditions. In
addition, it naturally handles the heterogeneity of sequencing depth in
different samples, removing the need for ad-hoc normalization. Efficient Gibbs
sampling inference of the GMNB model parameters is achieved by exploiting novel
data augmentation techniques. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world RNA-seq data show that GMNB outperforms existing methods in both
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves of
differential expression analysis results.
"
21678,The locality of quantum subsystems III: A 'subsystem compatible' interpretation of quantum mechanics,"  A local description of quantum subsystems can be used to construct ontologies
of the full quantum predictions. This paper communicates one possible way to do
so. A retrocausal interpretation of quantum mechanics where the de Broglie-Bohm
particles are the retrocausal agents is developed. This interpretation is
constrained to be compatible with the existence of a local realist description
of quantum subsystems.
"
21679,On the Oberlin affine curvature condition,"  In this paper we generalize the well-known notions of affine arclength and
affine hypersurface measure to submanifolds of any dimension $d$ in $\mathbb
R^n$ , $1 \leq d \leq n-1$. We show that a canonical affine invariant measure
exists and that, modulo sufficient regularity assumptions on the submanifold,
the measure satisfies the affine curvature condition of D. Oberlin with an
exponent which is best possible. The proof combines aspects of Geometric
Invariant Theory, convex geometry, and frame theory. A significant new element
of the proof is a generalization to higher dimensions of an earlier result of
the author concerning inequalities of reverse Sobolev type for polynomials on
arbitrary measurable subsets of the real line.
"
21680,GDSP: A Graphical Perspective on the Distributed Storage Systems,"  The classical distributed storage problem can be modeled by a k-uniform {\it
complete} hyper-graph where vertices represent servers and hyper-edges
represent users. Hence each hyper-edge should be able to recover the full file
using only the memories of the vertices associated with it. This paper
considers the generalization of this problem to {\it arbitrary} hyper-graphs
and to the case of multiple files, where each user is only interested in one, a
problem we will refer to as the graphical distributed storage problem (GDSP).
Specifically, we make progress in the analysis of minimum-storage codes for two
main subproblems of the GDSP which extend the classical model in two
independent directions: the case of an arbitrary graph with multiple files, and
the case of an arbitrary hyper-graph with a single file.
"
21681,Projected Coupled Cluster Theory,"  Coupled cluster theory is the method of choice for weakly correlated systems.
But in the strongly correlated regime, it faces a symmetry dilemma, where it
either completely fails to describe the system, or has to artificially break
certain symmetries. On the other hand, projected Hartree-Fock theory captures
the essential physics of many kinds of strong correlations via symmetry
breaking and restoration. In this work, we combine and try to retain the merits
of these two methods by applying symmetry projection to broken symmetry coupled
cluster wavefunctions. The non-orthogonal nature of states resulting from the
application of symmetry projection operators furnishes particle-hole
excitations to all orders, thus creating an obstacle for the exact evaluation
of overlaps. Here we provide a solution via a disentanglement framework theory
that can be approximated rigorously and systematically. Results of projected
coupled cluster theory are presented for molecules and the Hubbard model,
showing that spin projection significantly improves unrestricted coupled
cluster theory while restoring good quantum numbers. The energy of projected
coupled cluster theory reduces to the unprojected one in the thermodynamic
limit, albeit at a much slower rate than projected Hartree-Fock.
"
21682,"Existence, Uniqueness and Structure of Second Order absolute minimisers","  Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded open $C^{1,1}$ set. In this
paper we prove the existence of a unique second order absolute minimiser
$u_\infty$ of the functional \[ \mathrm{E}_\infty (u,\mathcal{O})\, :=\, \|
\mathrm{F}(\cdot, \Delta u) \|_{L^\infty( \mathcal{O} )}, \ \ \ \mathcal{O}
\subseteq \Omega \text{ measurable}, \] with prescribed boundary conditions for
$u$ and $\mathrm{D} u$ on $\partial \Omega$ and under natural assumptions on
$\mathrm{F}$. We also show that $u_\infty$ is partially smooth and there exists
a harmonic function $f_\infty \in L^1(\Omega)$ such that \[ \mathrm{F}(x,
\Delta u_\infty(x)) \, =\, e_\infty\, \mathrm{sgn}\big(f_\infty(x)\big) \] for
all $x \in \{f_\infty \neq 0\}$, where $e_\infty$ is the infimum of the global
energy.
"
21683,Interpretation of crystallographic groups under Riemann's elliptic geometry,"  This paper is devoted to the problem of choosing the most suitable model of a
geometrical system for describing the real crystallographic space. It has been
shown that all 230 crystallographic groups used to describe the crystalline
structures in a Euclidean space can be presented by elliptic motions in the
closed space $V^3$. Based on these results, it is stated that a special
geometric system---the crystallographic space of interpretation $R_E$,
determined by a form of an interpretant (the surface of a torus $T^2$ can serve
as this interpretant)---can serve as a geometrical model of the real
crystallographic space. The compact model of the closed structure of a crystal
has been proposed and ways of its treatment for visualizing the constructions
of elements of symmetry of a crystalline lattice in the Euclidean space $E^3$
have been determined. As a modeling space for describing the internal structure
of a crystal, the closed space $V^3$ with the elliptic metrics and constant
positive Gaussian curvature ($K=1$) has been offered. The properties of the
internal space of a real crystal are naturally deduced from the properties of
the modeling space.
"
21684,Safe Policy Improvement with Baseline Bootstrapping,"  A common goal in Reinforcement Learning is to derive a good strategy given a
limited batch of data. In this paper, we adopt the safe policy improvement
(SPI) approach: we compute a target policy guaranteed to perform at least as
well as a given baseline policy, approximately and with high probability. Our
SPI strategy, inspired by the knows-what-it-knows paradigm, consists in
bootstrapping the target with the baseline when the target does not know. We
develop two computationally efficient bootstrapping algorithms, one value-based
and one policy-based, both accompanied by theoretical SPI bounds for the
tabular case. We empirically show the limits of the existing algorithms on a
small stochastic gridworld problem, and then demonstrate that our algorithms
not only improve the worst-case scenario but also the mean performance.
"
21685,Efficient Preconditioning for Noisy Separable NMFs by Successive Projection Based Low-Rank Approximations,"  The successive projection algorithm (SPA) can quickly solve a nonnegative
matrix factorization problem under a separability assumption. Even if noise is
added to the problem, SPA is robust as long as the perturbations caused by the
noise are small. In particular, robustness against noise should be high when
handling the problems arising from real applications. The preconditioner
proposed by Gillis and Vavasis (2015) makes it possible to enhance the noise
robustness of SPA. Meanwhile, an additional computational cost is required. The
construction of the preconditioner contains a step to compute the top-$k$
truncated singular value decomposition of an input matrix. It is known that the
decomposition provides the best rank-$k$ approximation to the input matrix; in
other words, a matrix with the smallest approximation error among all matrices
of rank less than $k$. This step is an obstacle to an efficient implementation
of the preconditioned SPA.
To address the cost issue, we propose a modification of the algorithm for
constructing the preconditioner. Although the original algorithm uses the best
rank-$k$ approximation, instead of it, our modification uses an alternative.
Ideally, this alternative should have high approximation accuracy and low
computational cost. To ensure this, our modification employs a rank-$k$
approximation produced by an SPA based algorithm. We analyze the accuracy of
the approximation and evaluate the computational cost of the algorithm. We then
present an empirical study revealing the actual performance of the SPA based
rank-$k$ approximation algorithm and the modified preconditioned SPA.
"
21686,Intelligent bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees for optimal motion planning in complex cluttered environments,"  The sampling based motion planning algorithm known as Rapidly-exploring
Random Trees (RRT) has gained the attention of many researchers due to their
computational efficiency and effectiveness. Recently, a variant of RRT called
RRT* has been proposed that ensures asymptotic optimality. Subsequently its
bidirectional version has also been introduced in the literature known as
Bidirectional-RRT* (B-RRT*). We introduce a new variant called Intelligent
Bidirectional-RRT* (IB-RRT*) which is an improved variant of the optimal RRT*
and bidirectional version of RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithms and is specially designed
for complex cluttered environments. IB-RRT* utilizes the bidirectional trees
approach and introduces intelligent sample insertion heuristic for fast
convergence to the optimal path solution using uniform sampling heuristics. The
proposed algorithm is evaluated theoretically and experimental results are
presented that compares IB-RRT* with RRT* and B-RRT*. Moreover, experimental
results demonstrate the superior efficiency of IB-RRT* in comparison with RRT*
and B-RRT in complex cluttered environments.

"
21688,Asymptotic Expansion with Boundary Layer Analysis for Strongly Anisotropic Elliptic Equations,"  In this article, we derive the asymptotic expansion, up to an arbitrary order
in theory, for the solution of a two-dimensional elliptic equation with
strongly anisotropic diffusion coefficients along different directions, subject
to the Neumann boundary condition and the Dirichlet boundary condition on
specific parts of the domain boundary, respectively. The ill-posedness arising
from the Neumann boundary condition in the strongly anisotropic diffusion limit
is handled by the decomposition of the solution into a mean part and a
fluctuation part. The boundary layer analysis due to the Dirichlet boundary
condition is conducted for each order in the expansion for the fluctuation
part. Our results suggest that the leading order is the combination of the mean
part and the composite approximation of the fluctuation part for the general
Dirichlet boundary condition.
"
21689,Discovery and recognition of motion primitives in human activities,"  We present a novel framework for the automatic discovery and recognition of
motion primitives in videos of human activities. Given the 3D pose of a human
in a video, human motion primitives are discovered by optimizing the `motion
flux', a quantity which captures the motion variation of a group of skeletal
joints. A normalization of the primitives is proposed in order to make them
invariant with respect to a subject anatomical variations and data sampling
rate. The discovered primitives are unknown and unlabeled and are
unsupervisedly collected into classes via a hierarchical non-parametric Bayes
mixture model. Once classes are determined and labeled they are further
analyzed for establishing models for recognizing discovered primitives. Each
primitive model is defined by a set of learned parameters.
Given new video data and given the estimated pose of the subject appearing on
the video, the motion is segmented into primitives, which are recognized with a
probability given according to the parameters of the learned models.
Using our framework we build a publicly available dataset of human motion
primitives, using sequences taken from well-known motion capture datasets. We
expect that our framework, by providing an objective way for discovering and
categorizing human motion, will be a useful tool in numerous research fields
including video analysis, human inspired motion generation, learning by
demonstration, intuitive human-robot interaction, and human behavior analysis.
"
21690,DeePMD-kit: A deep learning package for many-body potential energy representation and molecular dynamics,"  Recent developments in many-body potential energy representation via deep
learning have brought new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency
dilemma in molecular simulations. Here we describe DeePMD-kit, a package
written in Python/C++ that has been designed to minimize the effort required to
build deep learning based representation of potential energy and force field
and to perform molecular dynamics. Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span
from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to
chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the
most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly
automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with
high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral)
molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus,
upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to
perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example
of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn
the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data
obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted
molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information
contained in the original model.
"
21691,"Small-depth Multilinear Formula Lower Bounds for Iterated Matrix Multiplication, with Applications","  In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$
many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$, and show that the
well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any
depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.
Formally, for each depth $\Delta \leq \log d$, we show that any product-depth
$\Delta$ multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have size
$\exp(\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})).$ It also follows from this that any
multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ for the same polynomial of the
above form must have a size of $\exp(\Omega(d^{1/\Delta})).$ In particular, any
polynomial-sized multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth
$\Omega(\log d)$, and any polynomial-sized multilinear circuit for
$\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth $\Omega(\log d/\log \log d).$ Both these
bounds are tight up to constant factors.
1. Depth-reduction: A well-known result of Brent (JACM 1974) implies that any
formula of size $s$ can be converted to one of size $s^{O(1)}$ and depth
$O(\log s)$; further, this reduction continues to hold for multilinear
formulas. Our lower bound implies that any depth-reduction in the multilinear
setting cannot reduce the depth to $o(\log s)$ without a superpolynomial
blow-up in size.
2. Separations from general formulas: Our result, along with a non-trivial
upper bound for $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$ implied by a result of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal
and Saptharishi (SICOMP 2016), shows that for any size $s$ and product-depth
$\Delta = o(\log s),$ general formulas of size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta$
cannot be converted to multilinear formulas of size $s^{\omega(1)}$ and
product-depth $\Delta,$ when the underlying field has characteristic zero.

21692,1-Dimensional Intrinsic Persistence of Geodesic Spaces,"  Given a compact geodesic space $X$ we apply the fundamental group and
alternatively the first homology group functor to the corresponding Rips or
Čech filtration of $X$ to obtain what we call a persistence. This paper
contains the theory describing such persistence: properties of the set of
critical points, their precise relationship to the size of holes, the structure
of persistence and the relationship between open and close, Rips and Čech
induced persistences. Amongst other results we prove that a Rips critical point
$c$ corresponds to an isometrically embedded circle of length $3c$, that a
homology persistence of a locally contractible space with coefficients in a
field encodes the lengths of the lexicographically smallest base and that Rips
and Čech induced persistences are isomorphic up to a factor $3/4$. The
theory describes geometric properties of the underlying space encoded and
extractable from persistence.
"
21693,Kalman Filter and its Modern Extensions for the Continuous-time Nonlinear Filtering Problem,"  This paper is concerned with the filtering problem in continuous-time. Three
algorithmic solution approaches for this problem are reviewed: (i) the
classical Kalman-Bucy filter which provides an exact solution for the linear
Gaussian problem, (ii) the ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (EnKBF) which is an
approximate filter and represents an extension of the Kalman-Bucy filter to
nonlinear problems, and (iii) the feedback particle filter (FPF) which
represents an extension of the EnKBF and furthermore provides for an consistent
solution in the general nonlinear, non-Gaussian case. The common feature of the
three algorithms is the gain times error formula to implement the update step
(to account for conditioning due to the observations) in the filter. In
contrast to the commonly used sequential Monte Carlo methods, the EnKBF and FPF
avoid the resampling of the particles in the importance sampling update step.
Moreover, the feedback control structure provides for error correction
potentially leading to smaller simulation variance and improved stability
properties. The paper also discusses the issue of non-uniqueness of the filter
update formula and formulates a novel approximation algorithm based on ideas
from optimal transport and coupling of measures. Performance of this and other
algorithms is illustrated for a numerical example.
"
21694,Okounkov bodies and transfinite diameter,"  We present an explicit calculation of an Okounkov body associated to an
algebraic variety. This is used to derive a formula for transfinite diameter on
the variety. We relate this formula to a recent result of D. Witt Nystrom.
"
21695,Spin Structures on Affine Kac-Moody Symmetric Spaces,"  We construct certain Fréchet principal $K$-bundles over affine Kac-Moody
symmetric spaces by means of the natural projection $G\rightarrow G/K$ where
$G$ is a (possibly twisted) geometric affine Kac-Moody group and $K$ is a real
form when $G$ is complex and a ""compact"" real form when $G$ is real.\ Then we
present two methods by means of which one can find certain spin structures on
affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces of compact type.\ We also briefly sketch
defining a Dirac-like operator on these spaces.
"
21696,Frequency patterns of semantic change: Corpus-based evidence of a near-critical dynamics in language change,"  It is generally believed that, when a linguistic item acquires a new meaning,
its overall frequency of use in the language rises with time with an S-shaped
growth curve. Yet, this claim has only been supported by a limited number of
case studies. In this paper, we provide the first corpus-based quantitative
confirmation of the genericity of the S-curve in language change. Moreover, we
uncover another generic pattern, a latency phase of variable duration preceding
the S-growth, during which the frequency of use of the semantically expanding
word remains low and more or less constant. We also propose a usage-based model
of language change supported by cognitive considerations, which predicts that
both phases, the latency and the fast S-growth, take place. The driving
mechanism is a stochastic dynamics, a random walk in the space of frequency of
use. The underlying deterministic dynamics highlights the role of a control
parameter, the strength of the cognitive impetus governing the onset of change,
which tunes the system at the vicinity of a saddle-node bifurcation. In the
neighborhood of the critical point, the latency phase corresponds to the
diffusion time over the critical region, and the S-growth to the fast
convergence that follows. The duration of the two phases is computed as
specific first passage times of the random walk process, leading to
distributions that fit well the ones extracted from our dataset. We argue that
our results are not specific to the studied corpus, but apply to semantic
change in general.
"
21697,On model fitting and estimation of strictly stationary processes,"  Stationary processes have been extensively studied in the literature. Their
applications include modeling and forecasting numerous real life phenomena such
as natural disasters, sales and market movements. When stationary processes are
considered, modeling is traditionally based on fitting an autoregressive moving
average (ARMA) process. However, we challenge this conventional approach.
Instead of fitting an ARMA model, we apply an AR(1) characterization in
modeling any strictly stationary processes. Moreover, we derive consistent and
asymptotically normal estimators of the corresponding model parameter.
"
21698,Spatially and time-resolved imaging of transport of indirect excitons in high magnetic fields,"  We present the direct measurements of magnetoexciton transport. Excitons give
the opportunity to realize the high magnetic field regime for composite bosons
with magnetic fields of a few Tesla. Long lifetimes of indirect excitons allow
the study kinetics of magnetoexciton transport with time-resolved optical
imaging of exciton photoluminescence. We performed spatially, spectrally, and
time-resolved optical imaging of transport of indirect excitons in high
magnetic fields. We observed that increasing magnetic field slows down
magnetoexciton transport. The time-resolved measurements of the magnetoexciton
transport distance allowed for an experimental estimation of the magnetoexciton
diffusion coefficient. An enhancement of the exciton photoluminescence energy
at the laser excitation spot was found to anti-correlate with the exciton
transport distance. A theoretical model of indirect magnetoexciton transport is
presented and is in agreement with the experimental data.
"
21699,"Data-Efficient Exploration, Optimization, and Modeling of Diverse Designs through Surrogate-Assisted Illumination","  The MAP-Elites algorithm produces a set of high-performing solutions that
vary according to features defined by the user. This technique has the
potential to be a powerful tool for design space exploration, but is limited by
the need for numerous evaluations. The Surrogate-Assisted Illumination
algorithm (SAIL), introduced here, integrates approximative models and
intelligent sampling of the objective function to minimize the number of
evaluations required by MAP-Elites.
The ability of SAIL to efficiently produce both accurate models and diverse
high performing solutions is illustrated on a 2D airfoil design problem. The
search space is divided into bins, each holding a design with a different
combination of features. In each bin SAIL produces a better performing solution
than MAP-Elites, and requires several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations.
The CMA-ES algorithm was used to produce an optimal design in each bin: with
the same number of evaluations required by CMA-ES to find a near-optimal
solution in a single bin, SAIL finds solutions of similar quality in every bin.
"
21700,A simple proof of the discrete time geometric Pontryagin maximum principle,"  We establish a geometric Pontryagin maximum principle for discrete time
optimal control problems on finite dimensional smooth manifolds under the
following three types of constraints: a) constraints on the states pointwise in
time, b) constraints on the control actions pointwise in time, c) constraints
on the frequency spectrum of the optimal control trajectories. Our proof
follows, in spirit, the path to establish geometric versions of the Pontryagin
maximum principle on smooth manifolds indicated in [Cha11] in the context of
continuous-time optimal control.
"
21701,On the Relationship between Conditional (CAR) and Simultaneous (SAR) Autoregressive Models,"  We clarify relationships between conditional (CAR) and simultaneous (SAR)
autoregressive models. We review the literature on this topic and find that it
is mostly incomplete. Our main result is that a SAR model can be written as a
unique CAR model, and while a CAR model can be written as a SAR model, it is
not unique. In fact, we show how any multivariate Gaussian distribution on a
finite set of points with a positive-definite covariance matrix can be written
as either a CAR or a SAR model. We illustrate how to obtain any number of SAR
covariance matrices from a single CAR covariance matrix by using Givens
rotation matrices on a simulated example. We also discuss sparseness in the
original CAR construction, and for the resulting SAR weights matrix. For a real
example, we use crime data in 49 neighborhoods from Columbus, Ohio, and show
that a geostatistical model optimizes the likelihood much better than typical
first-order CAR models. We then use the implied weights from the geostatistical
model to estimate CAR model parameters that provides the best overall
optimization.
"
21702,Natural Gradient Deep Q-learning,"  We present a novel algorithm to train a deep Q-learning agent using
natural-gradient techniques. We compare the original deep Q-network (DQN)
algorithm to its natural-gradient counterpart, which we refer to as NGDQN, on a
collection of classic control domains. Without employing target networks, NGDQN
significantly outperforms DQN without target networks, and performs no worse
than DQN with target networks, suggesting that NGDQN stabilizes training and
can help reduce the need for additional hyperparameter tuning. We also find
that NGDQN is less sensitive to hyperparameter optimization relative to DQN.
Together these results suggest that natural-gradient techniques can improve
value-function optimization in deep reinforcement learning.
"
21703,Volatility Models Applied to Geophysics and High Frequency Financial Market Data,"  This work is devoted to the study of modeling geophysical and financial time
series. A class of volatility models with time-varying parameters is presented
to forecast the volatility of time series in a stationary environment. The
modeling of stationary time series with consistent properties facilitates
prediction with much certainty. Using the GARCH and stochastic volatility
model, we forecast one-step-ahead suggested volatility with +/- 2 standard
prediction errors, which is enacted via Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We
compare the stochastic volatility model relying on the filtering technique as
used in the conditional volatility with the GARCH model. We conclude that the
stochastic volatility is a better forecasting tool than GARCH (1, 1), since it
is less conditioned by autoregressive past information.
"
21704,The Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations with the positive fractional power terms and their exact solutions,"  In this paper, the famous Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations are firstly
generalized, the new special types of Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations with the
positive fractional power terms (gKGZE) are presented. In order to derive the
exact solutions of new special gKGZE, the subsidiary higher order ordinary
differential equations (sub-ODEs) with the positive fractional power terms are
introduced, and with the aids of the Sub-ODE, the exact solutions of three
special types of the gKGZE are derived, which are the bell-type solitary wave
solution, the algebraic solitary wave solution, the kink-type solitary wave
solution and the sinusoidal traveling wave solution, provided that the
coefficients of gKGZE satisfy certain constraint conditions.
"
21705,Knowledge Rich Natural Language Queries over Structured Biological Databases,"  Increasingly, keyword, natural language and NoSQL queries are being used for
information retrieval from traditional as well as non-traditional databases
such as web, document, image, GIS, legal, and health databases. While their
popularity are undeniable for obvious reasons, their engineering is far from
simple. In most part, semantics and intent preserving mapping of a well
understood natural language query expressed over a structured database schema
to a structured query language is still a difficult task, and research to tame
the complexity is intense. In this paper, we propose a multi-level
knowledge-based middleware to facilitate such mappings that separate the
conceptual level from the physical level. We augment these multi-level
abstractions with a concept reasoner and a query strategy engine to dynamically
link arbitrary natural language querying to well defined structured queries. We
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by presenting a Datalog based
prototype system, called BioSmart, that can compute responses to arbitrary
natural language queries over arbitrary databases once a syntactic
classification of the natural language query is made.
"
21706,Diving Deep into Clickbaits: Who Use Them to What Extents in Which Topics with What Effects?,"  The use of alluring headlines (clickbait) to tempt the readers has become a
growing practice nowadays. For the sake of existence in the highly competitive
media industry, most of the on-line media including the mainstream ones, have
started following this practice. Although the wide-spread practice of clickbait
makes the reader's reliability on media vulnerable, a large scale analysis to
reveal this fact is still absent. In this paper, we analyze 1.67 million
Facebook posts created by 153 media organizations to understand the extent of
clickbait practice, its impact and user engagement by using our own developed
clickbait detection model. The model uses distributed sub-word embeddings
learned from a large corpus. The accuracy of the model is 98.3%. Powered with
this model, we further study the distribution of topics in clickbait and
non-clickbait contents.
"
21707,Symbolic Computations of First Integrals for Polynomial Vector Fields,"  In this article we show how to generalize to the Darbouxian, Liouvillian and
Riccati case the extactic curve introduced by J. Pereira. With this approach,
we get new algorithms for computing, if it exists, a rational, Darbouxian,
Liouvillian or Riccati first integral with bounded degree of a polynomial
planar vector field. We give probabilistic and deterministic algorithms. The
arithmetic complexity of our probabilistic algorithm is in
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^{\omega+1})$, where $N$ is the bound on the degree of a
representation of the first integral and $\omega \in [2;3]$ is the exponent of
linear algebra. This result improves previous algorithms. Our algorithms have
been implemented in Maple and are available on authors' websites. In the last
section, we give some examples showing the efficiency of these algorithms.
"
21708,Of Kernels and Queues: when network calculus meets analytic combinatorics,"  Stochastic network calculus is a tool for computing error bounds on the
performance of queueing systems. However, deriving accurate bounds for networks
consisting of several queues or subject to non-independent traffic inputs is
challenging. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of the tools from
analytic combinatorics, especially the kernel method, to tackle this problem.
Applying the kernel method allows us to compute the generating functions of the
queue state distributions in the stationary regime of the network. As a
consequence, error bounds with an arbitrary precision can be computed. In this
preliminary work, we focus on simple examples which are representative of the
difficulties that the kernel method allows us to overcome.
"
21709,Montgomery curves and their arithmetic,"  Three decades ago, Montgomery introduced a new elliptic curve model for use
in Lenstra's ECM factorization algorithm. Since then, his curves and the
algorithms associated with them have become foundational in the implementation
of elliptic curve cryptosystems. This article surveys the theory and
cryptographic applications of Montgomery curves over non-binary finite fields,
including Montgomery's x-only arithmetic and Ladder algorithm, x-only
Diffie--Hellman, y-coordinate recovery, and 2-dimensional and Euclidean
differential addition chains such as Montgomery's PRAC algorithm.
"
21710,Towards Interrogating Discriminative Machine Learning Models,"  It is oftentimes impossible to understand how machine learning models reach a
decision. While recent research has proposed various technical approaches to
provide some clues as to how a learning model makes individual decisions, they
cannot provide users with ability to inspect a learning model as a complete
entity. In this work, we propose a new technical approach that augments a
Bayesian regression mixture model with multiple elastic nets. Using the
enhanced mixture model, we extract explanations for a target model through
global approximation. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we evaluate
it on different learning models covering the tasks of text mining and image
recognition. Our results indicate that the proposed approach not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in explaining individual decisions
but also provides users with an ability to discover the vulnerabilities of a
learning model.
"
21711,Progressive Reinforcement Learning with Distillation for Multi-Skilled Motion Control,"  Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated increasing capabilities for
continuous control problems, including agents that can move with skill and
agility through their environment. An open problem in this setting is that of
developing good strategies for integrating or merging policies for multiple
skills, where each individual skill is a specialist in a specific skill and its
associated state distribution. We extend policy distillation methods to the
continuous action setting and leverage this technique to combine expert
policies, as evaluated in the domain of simulated bipedal locomotion across
different classes of terrain. We also introduce an input injection method for
augmenting an existing policy network to exploit new input features. Lastly,
our method uses transfer learning to assist in the efficient acquisition of new
skills. The combination of these methods allows a policy to be incrementally
augmented with new skills. We compare our progressive learning and integration
via distillation (PLAID) method against three alternative baselines.
"
21712,Sparse Approximation by Semidefinite Programming,"  The problem of sparse approximation and the closely related compressed
sensing have received tremendous attention in the past decade. Primarily
studied from the viewpoint of applied harmonic analysis and signal processing,
there have been two dominant algorithmic approaches to this problem: Greedy
methods called the matching pursuit (MP) and the linear programming based
approaches called the basis pursuit (BP). The aim of the current paper is to
bring a fresh perspective to sparse approximation by treating it as a
combinatorial optimization problem and providing an algorithm based on the
powerful optimization technique semidefinite programming (SDP). In particular,
we show that there is a randomized algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation
of the problem with performance guarantees depending on the coherence and the
restricted isometry constant of the dictionary used. We then show a
derandomization of the algorithm based on the method of conditional
probabilities.
"
21713,A note on gradient Einstein-type manifolds,"  In this note we show that a nontrivial, compact, degenerate or nondegenerate,
gradient Einstein-type manifold of constant scalar curvature is isometric to
the standard sphere with a well defined potential function. Moreover, under
some geometric assumptions the noncompact case is also treated. In this case,
the main result is that a homogeneous, proper, noncompact, nondegenerate,
gradient Einstein-type manifold is an Einstein manifold.
"
21714,Structural Learning and Integrative Decomposition of Multi-View Data,"  The increased availability of the multi-view data (data on the same samples
from multiple sources) has led to strong interest in models based on low-rank
matrix factorizations. These models represent each data view via shared and
individual components, and have been successfully applied for exploratory
dimension reduction, association analysis between the views, and further
learning tasks such as consensus clustering. Despite these advances, there
remain significant challenges in modeling partially-shared components, and
identifying the number of components of each type
(shared/partially-shared/individual). In this work, we formulate a novel linked
component model that directly incorporates partially-shared structures. We call
this model SLIDE for Structural Learning and Integrative DEcomposition of
multi-view data. We prove the existence of SLIDE decomposition and explicitly
characterize the identifiability conditions. The proposed model fitting and
selection techniques allow for joint identification of the number of components
of each type, in contrast to existing sequential approaches. In our empirical
studies, SLIDE demonstrates excellent performance in both signal estimation and
component selection. We further illustrate the methodology on the breast cancer
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas repository.
"
21715,Decentralized High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization with Factor Graphs,"  This paper presents a novel decentralized high-dimensional Bayesian
optimization (DEC-HBO) algorithm that, in contrast to existing HBO algorithms,
can exploit the interdependent effects of various input components on the
output of the unknown objective function f for boosting the BO performance and
still preserve scalability in the number of input dimensions without requiring
prior knowledge or the existence of a low (effective) dimension of the input
space. To realize this, we propose a sparse yet rich factor graph
representation of f to be exploited for designing an acquisition function that
can be similarly represented by a sparse factor graph and hence be efficiently
optimized in a decentralized manner using distributed message passing. Despite
richly characterizing the interdependent effects of the input components on the
output of f with a factor graph, DEC-HBO can still guarantee no-regret
performance asymptotically. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world
experiments (e.g., sparse Gaussian process model with 1811 hyperparameters)
shows that DEC-HBO outperforms the state-of-the-art HBO algorithms.
"
21716,Direct visualization of coexisting channels of interaction in CeSb,"  Our understanding of correlated electron systems is vexed by the complexity
of their interactions. Heavy fermion compounds are archetypal examples of this
physics, leading to exotic properties that weave together magnetism,
superconductivity and strange metal behavior. The Kondo semimetal CeSb is an
unusual example where different channels of interaction not only coexist, but
their physical signatures are coincident, leading to decades of debate about
the microscopic picture describing the interactions between the $f$ moments and
the itinerant electron sea. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
resonantly enhance the response of the Ce$f$-electrons across the magnetic
transitions of CeSb and find there are two distinct modes of interaction that
are simultaneously active, but on different kinds of carriers. This study is a
direct visualization of how correlated systems can reconcile the coexistence of
different modes on interaction - by separating their action in momentum space,
they allow their coexistence in real space.
"
21717,Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation Based Learning Algorithms for As-You-Go Deployment of Wireless Relay Networks along a Line,"  We are motivated by the need for impromptu (or as-you-go) deployment of
multihop wireless networks, by human agents or robots; the agent moves along a
line, makes wireless link quality measurements at regular intervals, and makes
on-line placement decisions using these measurements. As a first step, we have
formulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In
our earlier work, we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure
as-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii)
the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few
successive steps and then selects the best relay placement location. The latter
was shown to provide better performance but at the expense of more measurements
and deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quick
deployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, the
deployment algorithm should not require prior knowledge of the parameters of
the wireless propagation model. In [1] we, therefore, developed learning
algorithms for the explore-forward approach.
The current paper provides deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go
approach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an average
cost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption,
link outage probabilities, and the number of deployed relay nodes. First we
show structural results for the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the special
structure of the optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronous
stochastic approximation, we develop two learning algorithms that
asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deployment
progresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, and
hence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment of
emergency wireless networks.
"
21718,Log-aesthetic Curves as Similarity Geometric Analogue of Euler's Elasticae,"  In this paper we consider the log-aesthetic curves and their generalization
which are used in CAGD. We consider those curves under similarity geometry and
characterize them as stationary integrable flow on plane curves which is
governed by the Burgers equation. We propose a variational formulation of those
curves whose Euler-Lagrange equation yields the stationary Burgers equation.
Our result suggests that the log-aesthetic curves and their generalization can
be regarded as the similarity geometric analogue of Euler's elasticae.
"
21719,Local and global existence of solutions to a fourth-order parabolic equation modeling kinetic roughening and coarsening in thin films,"  In this paper we study both the Cauchy problem and the initial boundary value
problem for the equation $\partial_tu+\mbox{div}\left(\nabla\Delta u-{\bf
g}(\nabla u)\right)=0$. This equation has been proposed as a continuum model
for kinetic roughening and coarsening in thin films. In the Cauchy problem, we
obtain that local existence of a weak solution is guaranteed as long as the
vector-valued function ${\bf g}$ is continuous and the initial datum $u_0$ lies
in $C^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $\nabla u_0(x)$ being uniformly continuous and
bounded on $\mathbb{R}^N$ and that the global existence assertion also holds
true if we assume that ${\bf g}$ is locally Lipschitz and satisfies the growth
condition $|{\bf g}(\xi) |\leq c|\xi|^\alpha$ for some $c>0, \alpha\in (2, 3)$,
$\sup_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\nabla u_0|<\infty$, and the norm of $u_0$ in the space
$L^{\frac{(\alpha-1)N}{3-\alpha}}(\mathbb{R}^N) $ is sufficiently small. This
is done by exploring various properties of the biharmonic heat kernel. In the
initial boundary value problem, we assume that ${\bf g}$ is continuous and
satisfies the growth condition $|{\bf g}(\xi) |\leq c|\xi|^\alpha+c$ for some
$c, \alpha\in (0,\infty)$. Our investigations reveal that if $\alpha\leq 1$ we
have global existence of a weak solution, while if
$1<\alpha<\frac{N^2+2N+4}{N^2}$ only a local existence theorem can be
established. Our method here is based upon a new interpolation inequality,
which may be of interest in its own right.
"
21720,Stochastic Gradient Descent for Relational Logistic Regression via Partial Network Crawls,"  Research in statistical relational learning has produced a number of methods
for learning relational models from large-scale network data. While these
methods have been successfully applied in various domains, they have been
developed under the unrealistic assumption of full data access. In practice,
however, the data are often collected by crawling the network, due to
proprietary access, limited resources, and privacy concerns. Recently, we
showed that the parameter estimates for relational Bayes classifiers computed
from network samples collected by existing network crawlers can be quite
inaccurate, and developed a crawl-aware estimation method for such models
(Yang, Ribeiro, and Neville, 2017). In this work, we extend the methodology to
learning relational logistic regression models via stochastic gradient descent
from partial network crawls, and show that the proposed method yields accurate
parameter estimates and confidence intervals.
"
21721,Social Discrete Choice Models,"  Human decision making underlies data generating process in multiple
application areas, and models explaining and predicting choices made by
individuals are in high demand. Discrete choice models are widely studied in
economics and computational social sciences. As digital social networking
facilitates information flow and spread of influence between individuals, new
advances in modeling are needed to incorporate social information into these
models in addition to characteristic features affecting individual choices. In
this paper, we propose two novel models with scalable training algorithms:
local logistics graph regularization (LLGR) and latent class graph
regularization (LCGR) models. We add social regularization to represent
similarity between friends, and we introduce latent classes to account for
possible preference discrepancies between different social groups. Training of
the LLGR model is performed using alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM), and training of the LCGR model is performed using a specialized Monte
Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Scalability to large graphs is
achieved by parallelizing computation in both the expectation and the
maximization steps. The LCGR model is the first latent class classification
model that incorporates social relationships among individuals represented by a
given graph. To evaluate our two models, we consider three classes of data to
illustrate a typical large-scale use case in internet and social media
applications. We experiment on synthetic datasets to empirically explain when
the proposed model is better than vanilla classification models that do not
exploit graph structure. We also experiment on real-world data, including both
small scale and large scale real-world datasets, to demonstrate on which types
of datasets our model can be expected to outperform state-of-the-art models.
"
21722,Operator spreading and the emergence of dissipative hydrodynamics under unitary evolution with conservation laws,"  We study the scrambling of local quantum information in chaotic many-body
systems in the presence of a locally conserved quantity like charge or energy
that moves diffusively. The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling
sheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is
reversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative
process. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is
constrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading
operator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight
of the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is
described by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a
source that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This
emission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the
dissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local
conserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion
current. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a
butterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially
non-observable, thereby acting as the ""reservoir"" that facilitates the
dissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a
power law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of
the conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator
(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival
of the ballistic front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws,
it develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only
as a power of time instead of exponentially. We also derive these results
within an effective hydrodynamic description which contains multiple coupled
diffusion equations.
"
21723,Performance of New High-Precision Muon Tracking Detectors for the ATLAS Experiment,"  The goals of the ongoing and planned ATLAS muon detector upgrades are to
increase the acceptance for precision muon momentum measurement and triggering
and to improve the rate capability of the muon chambers in the high-background
regions corresponding to the increasing LHC luminosity. Smalldiameter Muon
Drift Tube (sMDT) chambers have been developed for these purposes. With half
the drift-tube diameter of the current ATLAS Muon Drift Tube (MDT) chambers
with 30 mm drift tube diameter and otherwise unchanged operating parameters,
the sMDT chambers share all the advantages of the MDTs, but have an about an
order of magnitude higher rate capability and can be installed in detector
regions where MDT chambers do not fit in. The construction of twelve chambers
for the feet regions of the ATLAS detector has been completed for the
installation in the winter shutdown 2016/17 of the Large Hadron Collider. The
purpose of this upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is to increase the
acceptance for three-point muon track measurement which substantially improves
the muon momentum resolution in the regions concerned.
"
21724,Exact electrodynamics versus standard optics for a slab of cold dense gas,"  We study light propagation through a slab of cold gas using both the standard
electrodynamics of polarizable media, and massive atom-by-atom simulations of
the electrodynamics. The main finding is that the predictions from the two
methods may differ qualitatively when the density of the atomic sample $\rho$
and the wavenumber of resonant light $k$ satisfy $\rho k^{-3}\gtrsim 1$. The
reason is that the standard electrodynamics is a mean-field theory, whereas for
sufficiently strong light-mediated dipole-dipole interactions the atomic sample
becomes correlated. The deviations from mean-field theory appear to scale with
the parameter $\rho k^{-3}$, and we demonstrate noticeable effects already at
$\rho k^{-3} \simeq 10^{-2}$. In dilute gases and in gases with an added
inhomogeneous broadening the simulations show shifts of the resonance lines in
qualitative agreement with the predicted Lorentz-Lorenz shift and ""cooperative
Lamb shift"", but the quantitative agreement is unsatisfactory. Our
interpretation is that the microscopic basis for the local-field corrections in
electrodynamics is not fully understood.
"
21725,Sparse Grid Discretizations based on a Discontinuous Galerkin Method,"  We examine and extend Sparse Grids as a discretization method for partial
differential equations (PDEs). Solving a PDE in $D$ dimensions has a cost that
grows as $O(N^D)$ with commonly used methods. Even for moderate $D$ (e.g.
$D=3$), this quickly becomes prohibitively expensive for increasing problem
size $N$. This effect is known as the Curse of Dimensionality. Sparse Grids
offer an alternative discretization method with a much smaller cost of $O(N
\log^{D-1}N)$. In this paper, we introduce the reader to Sparse Grids, and
extend the method via a Discontinuous Galerkin approach. We then solve the
scalar wave equation in up to $6+1$ dimensions, comparing cost and accuracy
between full and sparse grids. Sparse Grids perform far superior, even in three
dimensions. Our code is freely available as open source, and we encourage the
reader to reproduce the results we show.

21726,Study of the one-way speed of light anisotropy with particle beams,"  Concepts of high precision studies of the one-way speed of light anisotropy
are discussed. The high energy particle beam allows measurement of a one-way
speed of light anisotropy (SOLA) via analysis of the beam momentum variation
with sidereal phase without the use of synchronized clocks. High precision beam
position monitors could provide accurate monitoring of the beam orbit and
determination of the particle beam momentum with relative accuracy on the level
of $10^{-10}$, which corresponds to a limit on SOLA of $10^{-18}$ with existing
storage rings. A few additional versions of the experiment are also presented.
"
21727,Three-dimensional radiation dosimetry based on optically-stimulated luminescence,"  A new approach to three-dimensional (3D) dosimetry based on
optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) is presented. By embedding OSL-active
particles into a transparent silicone matrix (PDMS), the well-established
dosimetric properties of an OSL material are exploited in a 3D-OSL dosimeter.
By investigating prototype dosimeters in standard cuvettes in combination with
small test samples for OSL readers, it is shown that a sufficient transparency
of the 3D-OSL material can be combined with an OSL response giving an estimated
>10.000 detected photons in 1 second per 1mm3 voxel of the dosimeter at a dose
of 1 Gy. The dose distribution in the 3D-OSL dosimeters can be directly read
out optically without the need for subsequent reconstruction by computational
inversion algorithms. The dosimeters carry the advantages known from
personal-dosimetry use of OSL: the dose distribution following irradiation can
be stored with minimal fading for extended periods of time, and dosimeters are
reusable as they can be reset, e.g. by an intense (bleaching) light field.
"
21728,Stochastic Neighbor Embedding separates well-separated clusters,"  Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and its variants are widely used dimensionality
reduction techniques -- despite their popularity, no theoretical results are
known. We prove that the optimal SNE embedding of well-separated clusters from
high dimensions to any Euclidean space R^d manages to successfully separate the
clusters in a quantitative way. The result also applies to a larger family of
methods including a variant of t-SNE.
"
21729,Redshifts for galaxies in radio continuum surveys from Bayesian model fitting of HI 21-cm lines,"  We introduce a new Bayesian HI spectral line fitting technique capable of
obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for millions of galaxies in radio surveys
with the Square Kilometere Array (SKA). This technique is especially
well-suited to the low signal-to-noise regime that the redshifted 21-cm HI
emission line is expected to be observed in, especially with SKA Phase 1,
allowing for robust source detection. After selecting a set of continuum
objects relevant to large, cosmological-scale surveys with the first phase of
the SKA dish array (SKA1-MID), we simulate data corresponding to their HI line
emission as observed by the same telescope. We then use the MultiNest nested
sampling code to find the best-fitting parametrised line profile, providing us
with a full joint posterior probability distribution for the galaxy properties,
including redshift. This provides high quality redshifts, with redshift errors
$\Delta z / z <10^{-5}$, from radio data alone for some 1.8 million galaxies in
a representative 5000 square degree survey with the SKA1-MID instrument with
up-to-date sensitivity profiles. Interestingly, we find that the SNR definition
commonly used in forecast papers does not correlate well with the actual
detectability of an HI line using our method. We further detail how our method
could be improved with per-object priors and how it may be also used to give
robust constraints on other observables such as the HI mass function. We also
make our line fitting code publicly available for application to other data
sets.
"
21730,New upper bounds for Ramanujan primes,"  For $n\ge 1$, the $n^{\rm th}$ Ramanujan prime is defined as the smallest
positive integer $R_n$ such that for all $x\ge R_n$, the interval
$(\frac{x}{2}, x]$ has at least $n$ primes. We show that for every
$\epsilon>0$, there is a positive integer $N$ such that if
$\alpha=2n\left(1+\dfrac{\log 2+\epsilon}{\log n+j(n)}\right)$, then $R_n<
p_{[\alpha]}$ for all $n>N$, where $p_i$ is the $i^{\rm th}$ prime and $j(n)>0$
is any function that satisfies $j(n)\to \infty$ and $nj'(n)\to 0$.
"
21731,Thermal phases of correlated lattice boson: a classical fluctuation theory,"  We present a method that generalises the standard mean field theory of
correlated lattice bosons to include amplitude and phase fluctuations of the
$U(1)$ field that induces onsite particle number mixing. This arises formally
from an auxiliary field decomposition of the kinetic term in a Bose Hubbard
model. We solve the resulting problem, initially, by using a classical
approximation for the particle number mixing field and a Monte Carlo treatment
of the resulting bosonic model. In two dimensions we obtain $T_c$ scales that
dramatically improve on mean field theory and are within about 20% of full
quantum Monte Carlo estimates. The `classical approximation' ground state,
however, is still mean field, with an overestimate of the critical interaction,
$U_c$, for the superfluid to Mott transition. By further including low order
quantum fluctuations in the free energy functional we improve significantly on
the $U_c$, and the overall thermal phase diagram. The classical approximation
based method has a computational cost linear in system size. The methods
readily generalise to multispecies bosons and the presence of traps.
"
21732,Analytic Center Cutting Plane Methods for Variational Inequalities over Convex Bodies,"  An analytic center cutting plane method is an iterative algorithm based on
the computation of analytic centers. In this paper, we propose some analytic
center cutting plane methods for solving quasimonotone or pseudomonotone
variational inequalities whose domains are bounded or unbounded convex bodies.
"
21733,Does Viscosity turn inflation into the CMB and $Λ$,"  Consideration of the entropy production in the creation of the CMB leads to a
simple model of the evolution of the universe during this period which suggests
a connection between the small observed acceleration term and the early
inflation of a closed universe. From this we find an unexpected relationship
between the Omega's of cosmology and calculate the total volume of the
universe.
"
21734,The Secrecy Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Channels with Finite Memory - Full Version,"  In this work we study the secrecy capacity of Gaussian multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channels (WTCs) with a finite memory, subject to
a per-symbol average power constraint on the MIMO channel input. MIMO channels
with finite memory are very common in wireless communications as well as in
wireline communications (e.g., in communications over power lines). To derive
the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian MIMO WTC with finite memory we first
construct an asymptotically-equivalent block-memoryless MIMO WTC, which is then
transformed into a set of parallel, independent, memoryless MIMO WTCs in the
frequency domain. The secrecy capacity of the Gaussian MIMO WTC with finite
memory is obtained as the secrecy capacity of the set of parallel independent
memoryless MIMO WTCs, and is expressed as a maximization over the input
covariance matrices in the frequency domain. Lastly, we detail two applications
of our result: First, we show that the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian scalar
WTC with finite memory can be achieved by waterfilling, and obtain a
closed-form expression for this secrecy capacity. Then, we use our result to
characterize the secrecy capacity of narrowband powerline channels, thereby
resolving one of the major open issues for this channel model.
"
21735,"On the Algebro-Geometric Analysis of Meromorphic (1,0)-forms","  In this paper, we analyze the theory of meromorphic $(1,0)$-forms
$\omega\in\mathcal{M}\Omega^{(1,0)}(\mathbb{CP}^1).$ Hence, we show that on a
compact Riemann surface of genus $g=0,$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{CP}^1,$ every
non-constant meromorphic function $f:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1$ has as many zeros as
poles, where each is counted according to multiplicities. Such an analysis
gives rise to the following result. Invoking the Riemann-Roch theorem for a
compact Riemann $X$ with canonical divisor $K,$ it follows that $deg(f)=0$ for
any principal divisor $(f):=D$ on $X.$ More precisely,
$\ell(D)-\ell(K-D)=deg(D)+1=1$ or $\ell(D)-\ell(K-D)-1=0.$ Furthermore, for a
diffeomorphism $\eta:X\to\mathbb{CP}^1$ of a certain kind, a multistep program
is implemented to show $X$ is a compact algebraic variety of dimension one,
i.e. a non-singular projective variety. Hence, we adopt a group-theoretic
approach and provide a useful heuristic, that is, a set of technical conditions
to facilitate the algebro-geometric analysis of simply connected Riemann
surfaces $X.$
"
21736,Tool Supported Analysis of IoT,"  The design of IoT systems could benefit from the combination of two different
analyses. We perform a first analysis to approximate how data flow across the
system components, while the second analysis checks their communication
soundness. We show how the combination of these two analyses yields further
benefits hardly achievable by separately using each of them. We exploit two
independently developed tools for the analyses.
Firstly, we specify IoT systems in IoT-LySa, a simple specification language
featuring asynchronous multicast communication of tuples. The values carried by
the tuples are drawn from a term-algebra obtained by a parametric signature.
The analysis of communication soundness is supported by ChorGram, a tool
developed to verify the compatibility of communicating finite-state machines.
In order to combine the analyses we implement an encoding of IoT-LySa processes
into communicating machines. This encoding is not completely straightforward
because IoT-LySa has multicast communications with data, while communication
machines are based on point-to-point communications where only finitely many
symbols can be exchanged. To highlight the benefits of our approach we appeal
to a simple yet illustrative example.
"
21737,Deep Learning for Ontology Reasoning,"  In this work, we present a novel approach to ontology reasoning that is based
on deep learning rather than logic-based formal reasoning. To this end, we
introduce a new model for statistical relational learning that is built upon
deep recursive neural networks, and give experimental evidence that it can
easily compete with, or even outperform, existing logic-based reasoners on the
task of ontology reasoning. More precisely, we compared our implemented system
with one of the best logic-based ontology reasoners at present, RDFox, on a
number of large standard benchmark datasets, and found that our system attained
high reasoning quality, while being up to two orders of magnitude faster.
"
21738,Wide applicability of high $T_c$ pairing originating from coexisting wide and incipient narrow bands in quasi one dimension,"  We study superconductivity in the Hubbard model on various
quasi-one-dimensional lattices with coexisting wide and narrow bands
originating from multiple sites within a unit cell, where each site corresponds
to a single orbital. The systems studied are the 2-leg and 3-leg ladders, the
diamond chain, and the criss-cross ladder. These one-dimensional lattices are
weakly coupled to form two-dimensional (quasi-one-dimensional) ones, and the
fluctuation exchange approximation is adopted to study
spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. When one of the bands is perfectly
flat, and the Fermi level, intersecting the wide band, is placed in the
vicinity of the flat band, superconductivity arising from the interband
scattering processes is found to be strongly enhanced owing to the combination
of the light electron mass of the wide band and the strong pairing interaction
due to the large density of states of the flat band. Even when the narrow band
has finite band width, the pairing mechanism still works since the edge of the
narrow band, due to its large density of states, plays the role of the flat
band. The results indicate the generality of the high $T_c$ pairing mechanism
due to coexisting wide and ""incipient"" narrow bands in quasi-one-dimensional
systems.
"
21739,Analysis and design of Raptor codes using a multi-edge framework,"  The focus of this paper is on the analysis and design of Raptor codes using a
multi-edge framework. In this regard, we first represent the Raptor code as a
multi-edge type low-density parity-check (METLDPC) code. This MET
representation gives a general framework to analyze and design Raptor codes
over a binary input additive white Gaussian noise channel using MET density
evolution (MET-DE). We consider a joint decoding scheme based on the belief
propagation (BP) decoding for Raptor codes in the multi-edge framework, and
analyze the convergence behavior of the BP decoder using MET-DE. In joint
decoding of Raptor codes, the component codes correspond to inner code and
precode are decoded in parallel and provide information to each other. We also
derive an exact expression for the stability of Raptor codes with joint
decoding. We then propose an efficient Raptor code design method using the
multi-edge framework, where we simultaneously optimize the inner code and the
precode. Finally we consider performance-complexity trade-offs of Raptor codes
using the multi-edge framework. Through density evolution analysis we show that
the designed Raptor codes using the multi-edge framework outperform the
existing Raptor codes in literature in terms of the realized rate.
"
21740,Geometric structures and Lie algebroids,"  In this thesis we study geometric structures from Poisson and generalized
complex geometry with mild singular behavior using Lie algebroids. The process
of lifting such structures to their Lie algebroid version makes them less
singular, as their singular behavior is incorporated in the anchor of the Lie
algebroid. We develop a framework for this using the concept of a divisor,
which encodes the singularities, and show when structures exhibiting such
singularities can be lifted to a Lie algebroid built out of the divisor. Once
one has successfully lifted the structure, it becomes possible to study it
using more powerful techniques. In the case of Poisson structures one can turn
to employing symplectic techniques. These lead for example to normal form
results for the underlying Poisson structures around their singular loci. In
this thesis we further adapt the methods of Gompf and Thurston for constructing
symplectic structures out of fibration-like maps to their Lie algebroid
counterparts. More precisely, we introduce the notion of a Lie algebroid
Lefschetz fibration and show when these give rise to A-symplectic structures
for a given Lie algebroid A. We then use this general result to show how
log-symplectic structures arise out of achiral Lefschetz fibrations. Moreover,
we introduce the concept of a boundary Lefschetz fibration and show when they
allow their total space to be equipped with a stable generalized complex
structure. Other results in this thesis include homotopical obstructions to the
existence of A-symplectic structures using characteristic classes, and
splitting results for A-Lie algebroids (i.e., Lie algebroids whose anchor
factors through that of a fixed Lie algebroid A), around specific transversal
submanifolds.
"
21741,Financial Trading as a Game: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"  An automatic program that generates constant profit from the financial market
is lucrative for every market practitioner. Recent advance in deep
reinforcement learning provides a framework toward end-to-end training of such
trading agent. In this paper, we propose an Markov Decision Process (MDP) model
suitable for the financial trading task and solve it with the state-of-the-art
deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) algorithm. We propose several modifications to
the existing learning algorithm to make it more suitable under the financial
trading setting, namely 1. We employ a substantially small replay memory (only
a few hundreds in size) compared to ones used in modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms (often millions in size.) 2. We develop an action
augmentation technique to mitigate the need for random exploration by providing
extra feedback signals for all actions to the agent. This enables us to use
greedy policy over the course of learning and shows strong empirical
performance compared to more commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration. However,
this technique is specific to financial trading under a few market assumptions.
3. We sample a longer sequence for recurrent neural network training. A side
product of this mechanism is that we can now train the agent for every T steps.
This greatly reduces training time since the overall computation is down by a
factor of T. We combine all of the above into a complete online learning
algorithm and validate our approach on the spot foreign exchange market.
"
21742,The Confinement of Vortices in Nano-Superconducting Devices,"  We have investigated the confinement of 3-D vortices in specific cases of
Type-II ($\kappa = 2$) nano-superconducting devices. The emergent pattern of
vortices greatly depends on the orientation of an applied magnetic field
(transverse or longitudinal), and the size of the devices (a few coherence
lengths $\xi$). Herein, cylindrical geometries are examined. The surface
barriers become very significant in these nano-systems, and hence the
characteristics of the vortices become highly sensitive to the shape of the
system and direction of an applied field. It is observed that nano-cylindrical
superconductors, depending on their sizes, can display either first or second
order phase transitions, under the influence of a longitudinal field. In the
confined geometries, nucleation of a giant vortex state composed of a n-quanta
emerges for the longitudinal magnetic field.
"
21743,Design and Implementation of Modified Fuzzy based CPU Scheduling Algorithm,"  CPU Scheduling is the base of multiprogramming. Scheduling is a process which
decides order of task from a set of multiple tasks that are ready to execute.
There are number of CPU scheduling algorithms available, but it is very
difficult task to decide which one is better. This paper discusses the design
and implementation of modified fuzzy based CPU scheduling algorithm. This paper
present a new set of fuzzy rules. It demonstrates that scheduling done with new
priority improves average waiting time and average turnaround time.
"
21744,Message-Passing Methods for Complex Contagions,"  Message-passing methods provide a powerful approach for calculating the
expected size of cascades either on random networks (e.g., drawn from a
configuration-model ensemble or its generalizations) asymptotically as the
number $N$ of nodes becomes infinite or on specific finite-size networks. We
review the message-passing approach and show how to derive it for
configuration-model networks using the methods of (Dhar et al., 1997) and
(Gleeson, 2008). Using this approach, we explain for such networks how to
determine an analytical expression for a ""cascade condition"", which determines
whether a global cascade will occur. We extend this approach to the
message-passing methods for specific finite-size networks (Shrestha and Moore,
2014; Lokhov et al., 2015), and we derive a generalized cascade condition.
Throughout this chapter, we illustrate these ideas using the Watts threshold
model.
"
21745,Phase Transitions of the Typical Algorithmic Complexity of the Random Satisfiability Problem Studied with Linear Programming,"  Here we study the NP-complete $K$-SAT problem. Although the worst-case
complexity of NP-complete problems is conjectured to be exponential, there
exist parametrized random ensembles of problems where solutions can typically
be found in polynomial time for suitable ranges of the parameter. In fact,
random $K$-SAT, with $\alpha=M/N $ as control parameter, can be solved quickly
for small enough values of $\alpha$. It shows a phase transition between a
satisfiable phase and an unsatisfiable phase. For branch and bound algorithms,
which operate in the space of feasible Boolean configurations, the empirically
hardest problems are located only close to this phase transition. Here we study
$K$-SAT ($K=3,4$) and the related optimization problem MAX-SAT by a linear
programming approach, which is widely used for practical problems and allows
for polynomial run time. In contrast to branch and bound it operates outside
the space of feasible configurations. On the other hand, finding a solution
within polynomial time is not guaranteed. We investigated several variants like
including artificial objective functions, so called cutting-plane approaches,
and a mapping to the NP-complete vertex-cover problem. We observed several
easy-hard transitions, from where the problems are typically solvable (in
polynomial time) using the given algorithms, respectively, to where they are
not solvable in polynomial time. For the related vertex-cover problem on random
graphs these easy-hard transitions can be identified with structural properties
of the graphs, like percolation transitions. For the present random $K$-SAT
problem we have investigated numerous structural properties also exhibiting
clear transitions, but they appear not be correlated to the here observed
easy-hard transitions. This renders the behaviour of random $K$-SAT more
complex than, e.g., the vertex-cover problem.
"
21746,Unconstrained and Curvature-Constrained Shortest-Path Distances and their Approximation,"  We study shortest paths and their distances on a subset of a Euclidean space,
and their approximation by their equivalents in a neighborhood graph defined on
a sample from that subset. In particular, we recover and extend the results of
Bernstein et al. (2000). We do the same with curvature-constrained shortest
paths and their distances, establishing what we believe are the first
approximation bounds for them.
"
21747,Hecke module structure on first and top pro-$p$-Iwahori cohomology,"  Let $p\geq 5$ be a prime number, $G$ a split connected reductive group
defined over a $p$-adic field, and $I_1$ a choice of pro-$p$-Iwahori subgroup.
Let $C$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$ and
$\mathcal{H}$ the pro-$p$-Iwahori--Hecke algebra over $C$ associated to $I_1$.
In this note, we compute the action of $\mathcal{H}$ on $\textrm{H}^1(I_1,C)$
and $\textrm{H}^{\textrm{top}}(I_1,C)$ when the root system of $G$ is
irreducible. We also give some partial results in the general case.
"
21748,Sensitivity Properties of Intermittent Control,"  The sensitivity properties of intermittent control are analysed and the
conditions for a limit cycle derived theoretically and verified by simulation.
"
21749,Algebra of distributions of quantum-field densities and space-time properties,"  In this paper we consider properties of the space-time manifold M caused by
the proposition that, according to the scheme theory, the manifold M is locally
isomorphic to the spectrum of the algebra A, M = Spec(A), where A is the
commutative algebra of distributions of quantum-field densities. In order to
determine the algebra A, it is necessary to define multiplication on densities
and to eliminate those densities, which cannot be multiplied. This leads to
essential restrictions imposed on densities and on space-time properties. It is
found that the only possible case, when the commutative algebra A exists, is
the case, when the quantum fields are in the spacetime manifold M with the
structure group SO(3,1) (Lorentz group). The algebra A consists of
distributions of densities with singularities in the closed future light cone
subset. On account of the local isomorphism M = Spec(A), the quantum fields
exist only in the space-time manifold with the one-dimensional arrow of time.
In the fermion sector the restrictions caused by the possibility to define the
multiplication on the densities of spinor fields can explain the chirality
violation. It is found that for bosons in the Higgs sector the charge
conjugation symmetry violation on the densities of states can be observed. This
symmetry violation can explain the matter-antimatter imbalance.
"
21750,Minimal penalties and the slope heuristics: a survey,"  Birg{é} and Massart proposed in 2001 the slope heuristics as a way to
choose optimally from data an unknown multiplicative constant in front of a
penalty. It is built upon the notion of minimal penalty, and it has been
generalized since to some 'minimal-penalty algorithms'. This paper reviews the
theoretical results obtained for such algorithms, with a self-contained proof
in the simplest framework, precise proof ideas for further generalizations, and
a few new results. Explicit connections are made with residual-variance
estimators-with an original contribution on this topic, showing that for this
task the slope heuristics performs almost as well as a residual-based estimator
with the best model choice-and some classical algorithms such as L-curve or
elbow heuristics, Mallows' C p , and Akaike's FPE. Practical issues are also
addressed, including two new practical definitions of minimal-penalty
algorithms that are compared on synthetic data to previously-proposed
definitions. Finally, several conjectures and open problems are suggested as
future research directions.
"
21751,Fast and Robust Detection of Fallen People from a Mobile Robot,"  This paper deals with the problem of detecting fallen people lying on the
floor by means of a mobile robot equipped with a 3D depth sensor. In the
proposed algorithm, inspired by semantic segmentation techniques, the 3D scene
is over-segmented into small patches. Fallen people are then detected by means
of two SVM classifiers: the first one labels each patch, while the second one
captures the spatial relations between them. This novel approach showed to be
robust and fast. Indeed, thanks to the use of small patches, fallen people in
real cluttered scenes with objects side by side are correctly detected.
Moreover, the algorithm can be executed on a mobile robot fitted with a
standard laptop making it possible to exploit the 2D environmental map built by
the robot and the multiple points of view obtained during the robot navigation.
Additionally, this algorithm is robust to illumination changes since it does
not rely on RGB data but on depth data. All the methods have been thoroughly
validated on the IASLAB-RGBD Fallen Person Dataset, which is published online
as a further contribution. It consists of several static and dynamic sequences
with 15 different people and 2 different environments.
"
21752,On residual and guided proposals for diffusion bridge simulation,"  Recently Whitaker et al. (2017) considered Bayesian estimation of diffusion
driven mixed effects models using data-augmentation. The missing data,
diffusion bridges connecting discrete time observations, are drawn using a
""residual bridge construct"". In this paper we compare this construct (which we
call residual proposal) with the guided proposals introduced in Schauer et al.
2017. It is shown that both approaches are related, but use a different
approximation to the intractable stochastic differential equation of the true
diffusion bridge. It reveals that the computational complexity of both
approaches is similar. Some examples are included to compare the ability of
both proposals to capture local nonlinearities in the dynamics of the true
bridge.
"
21753,CHEERS: The chemical evolution RGS sample,"  The chemical yields of supernovae and the metal enrichment of the hot
intra-cluster medium (ICM) are not well understood. This paper introduces the
CHEmical Enrichment RGS Sample (CHEERS), which is a sample of 44 bright local
giant ellipticals, groups and clusters of galaxies observed with XMM-Newton.
This paper focuses on the abundance measurements of O and Fe using the
reflection grating spectrometer (RGS). The deep exposures and the size of the
sample allow us to quantify the intrinsic scatter and the systematic
uncertainties in the abundances using spectral modeling techniques. We report
the oxygen and iron abundances as measured with RGS in the core regions of all
objects in the sample. We do not find a significant trend of O/Fe as a function
of cluster temperature, but we do find an intrinsic scatter in the O and Fe
abundances from cluster to cluster. The level of systematic uncertainties in
the O/Fe ratio is estimated to be around 20-30%, while the systematic
uncertainties in the absolute O and Fe abundances can be as high as 50% in
extreme cases. We were able to identify and correct a systematic bias in the
oxygen abundance determination, which was due to an inaccuracy in the spectral
model. The lack of dependence of O/Fe on temperature suggests that the
enrichment of the ICM does not depend on cluster mass and that most of the
enrichment likely took place before the ICM was formed. We find that the
observed scatter in the O/Fe ratio is due to a combination of intrinsic scatter
in the source and systematic uncertainties in the spectral fitting, which we
are unable to disentangle. The astrophysical source of intrinsic scatter could
be due to differences in AGN activity and ongoing star formation in the BCG.
The systematic scatter is due to uncertainties in the spatial line broadening,
absorption column, multi-temperature structure and the thermal plasma models.

"
21754,Learning to Search via Retrospective Imitation,"  We study the problem of learning a good search policy from demonstrations for
combinatorial search spaces. We propose retrospective imitation learning,
which, after initial training by an expert, improves itself by learning from
its own retrospective solutions. That is, when the policy eventually reaches a
feasible solution in a search tree after making mistakes and backtracks, it
retrospectively constructs an improved search trace to the solution by removing
backtracks, which is then used to further train the policy. A key feature of
our approach is that it can iteratively scale up, or transfer, to larger
problem sizes than the initial expert demonstrations, thus dramatically
expanding its applicability beyond that of conventional imitation learning. We
showcase the effectiveness of our approach on two tasks: synthetic maze
solving, and integer program based risk-aware path planning.
"
21755,Electronic fitness function for screening semiconductors as thermoelectric materials,"  We introduce a simple but efficient electronic fitness function (EFF) that
describes the electronic aspect of the thermoelectric performance. This EFF
finds materials that overcome the inverse relationship between $\sigma$ and $S$
based on the complexity of the electronic structures regardless of specific
origin (e.g., isosurface corrugation, valley degeneracy, heavy-light bands
mixture, valley anisotropy or reduced dimensionality). This function is well
suited for application in high throughput screening. We applied this function
to 75 different thermoelectric and potential thermoelectric materials including
full- and half-Heuslers, binary semiconductors and Zintl phases. We find an
efficient screening using this transport function. The EFF identifies known
high performance $p$- and $n$-type Zintl phases and half-Heuslers. In addition,
we find some previously unstudied phases with superior EFF.
"
21756,Density Functional Theory of doped superfluid liquid helium and nanodroplets,"  During the last decade, density function theory (DFT) in its static and
dynamic time dependent forms, has emerged as a powerful tool to describe the
structure and dynamics of doped liquid helium and droplets. In this review, we
summarize the activity carried out in this field within the DFT framework since
the publication of the previous review article on this subject [M. Barranco et
al., J. Low Temp. Phys. 142, 1 (2006)]. Furthermore, a comprehensive
presentation of the actual implementations of helium DFT is given, which have
not been discussed in the individual articles or are scattered in the existing
literature. This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published on August 2,
2017 by Taylor & Francis Group in Int. Rev. Phys. Chem. 36, 621 (2017),

"
21757,Higher degree S-lemma and the stability of quadratic modules,"  In this work we will investigate a certain generalization of the so called
S-lemma in higher degrees. The importance of this generalization is, that it is
closely related to Hilbert's 1888 theorem about tenary quartics. In fact, if
such a generalization exits, then one can state a Hilbert-like theorem, where
positivity is only demanded on some semi-algebraic set. We will show that such
a generalization is not possible, at least not without additional conditions.
To prove this, we will use and generalize certain tools developed by Netzer
([Ne]). These new tools will allow us to conclude that this generalization of
the S-lemma is not possible because of geometric reasons. Furthermore, we are
able to establish a link between geometric reasons and algebraic reasons. This
will be accomplished within the framework of quadratic modules.
"
21758,Phantom Domain Walls,"  We consider a model with two real scalar fields which admits phantom domain
wall solutions. We investigate the structure and evolution of these phantom
domain walls in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic universe. In particular,
we show that the increase of the tension of the domain walls with cosmic time,
associated to the evolution of the phantom scalar field, is responsible for an
additional damping term in their equations of motion. We describe the
macroscopic dynamics of phantom domain walls, showing that extended phantom
defects whose tension varies on a cosmological timescale cannot be the dark
energy.
"
21759,Causally Regularized Learning with Agnostic Data Selection Bias,"  Most of previous machine learning algorithms are proposed based on the i.i.d.
hypothesis. However, this ideal assumption is often violated in real
applications, where selection bias may arise between training and testing
process. Moreover, in many scenarios, the testing data is not even available
during the training process, which makes the traditional methods like transfer
learning infeasible due to their need on prior of test distribution. Therefore,
how to address the agnostic selection bias for robust model learning is of
paramount importance for both academic research and real applications. In this
paper, under the assumption that causal relationships among variables are
robust across domains, we incorporate causal technique into predictive modeling
and propose a novel Causally Regularized Logistic Regression (CRLR) algorithm
by jointly optimize global confounder balancing and weighted logistic
regression. Global confounder balancing helps to identify causal features,
whose causal effect on outcome are stable across domains, then performing
logistic regression on those causal features constructs a robust predictive
model against the agnostic bias. To validate the effectiveness of our CRLR
algorithm, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real
world datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that our CRLR
algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and the interpretability of
our method can be fully depicted by the feature visualization.

21760,The K-inductive Structure of the Noncommutative Fourier Transform,"  The noncommutative Fourier transform of the irrational rotation C*-algebra is
shown to have a K-inductive structure (at least for a large concrete class of
irrational parameters, containing dense $G_\delta$'s). This is a structure for
automorphisms that is analogous to Huaxin Lin's notion of tracially AF for
C*-algebras, except that it requires more structure from the complementary
projection.
"
21761,Rigidity of inversive distance circle packings revisited,"  Inversive distance circle packing metric was introduced by P Bowers and K
Stephenson \cite{BS} as a generalization of Thurston's circle packing metric
\cite{T1}. They conjectured that the inversive distance circle packings are
rigid. For nonnegative inversive distance, Guo \cite{Guo} proved the
infinitesimal rigidity and then Luo \cite{L3} proved the global rigidity. In
this paper, based on an observation of Zhou \cite{Z}, we prove this conjecture
for inversive distance in $(-1, +\infty)$ by variational principles. We also
study the global rigidity of a combinatorial curvature introduced in
\cite{GJ4,GX4,GX6} with respect to the inversive distance circle packing
metrics where the inversive distance is in $(-1, +\infty)$.
"
21762,Continuous and discrete one dimensional autonomous fractional ODEs,"  In this paper, we study 1D autonomous fractional ODEs $D_c^{\gamma}u=f(u), 0<
\gamma <1$, where $u: [0,\infty)\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ is the unknown function and
$D_c^{\gamma}$ is the generalized Caputo derivative introduced by Li and Liu (
arXiv:1612.05103). Based on the existence and uniqueness theorem and regularity
results in previous work, we show the monotonicity of solutions to the
autonomous fractional ODEs and several versions of comparison principles. We
also perform a detailed discussion of the asymptotic behavior for $f(u)=Au^p$.
In particular, based on an Osgood type blow-up criteria, we find relatively
sharp bounds of the blow-up time in the case $A>0, p>1$. These bounds indicate
that as the memory effect becomes stronger ($\gamma\to 0$), if the initial
value is big, the blow-up time tends to zero while if the initial value is
small, the blow-up time tends to infinity. In the case $A<0, p>1$, we show that
the solution decays to zero more slowly compared with the usual derivative.
Lastly, we show several comparison principles and Grönwall inequalities for
discretized equations, and perform some numerical simulations to confirm our
analysis.
"
21763,Learning Vector Autoregressive Models with Latent Processes,"  We study the problem of learning the support of transition matrix between
random processes in a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model from samples when a
subset of the processes are latent. It is well known that ignoring the effect
of the latent processes may lead to very different estimates of the influences
among observed processes, and we are concerned with identifying the influences
among the observed processes, those between the latent ones, and those from the
latent to the observed ones. We show that the support of transition matrix
among the observed processes and lengths of all latent paths between any two
observed processes can be identified successfully under some conditions on the
VAR model. From the lengths of latent paths, we reconstruct the latent subgraph
(representing the influences among the latent processes) with a minimum number
of variables uniquely if its topology is a directed tree. Furthermore, we
propose an algorithm that finds all possible minimal latent graphs under some
conditions on the lengths of latent paths. Our results apply to both
non-Gaussian and Gaussian cases, and experimental results on various synthetic
and real-world datasets validate our theoretical results.
"
21764,Development of Single-Shot Multi-Frame Imaging of Cylindrical Shock Waves in a Multi-Layered Assembly,"  We demonstrate single-shot multi-frame imaging of quasi-2D cylindrically
converging shock waves as they propagate through a multi-layer target sample
assembly. We visualize the shock with sequences of up to 16 images, using a
Fabry-Perot cavity to generate a pulse train that can be used in various
imaging configurations. We employ multi-frame shadowgraph and dark-field
imaging to measure the amplitude and phase of the light transmitted through the
shocked target. Single-shot multi-frame imaging tracks geometric distortion and
additional features in our images that were not previously resolvable in this
experimental geometry. Analysis of our images, in combination with simulations,
shows that the additional image features are formed by a coupled wave structure
resulting from interface effects in our targets. This technique presents a new
capability for tabletop imaging of shock waves that can be easily extended to
experiments at large-scale facilities.
"
21765,Design rules for modulation-doped AlAs quantum wells,"  Thanks to their multi-valley, anisotropic, energy band structure,
two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) in modulation-doped AlAs quantum wells
(QWs) provide a unique platform to investigate electron interaction physics and
ballistic transport. Indeed, a plethora of phenomena unseen in other 2DESs have
been observed over the past decade. However, a foundation for sample design is
still lacking for AlAs 2DESs, limiting the means to achieve optimal quality
samples. Here we present a systematic study on the fabrication of
modulation-doped AlAs and GaAs QWs over a wide range of AlxGa1-xAs barrier
alloy compositions. Our data indicate clear similarities in modulation doping
mechanisms for AlAs and GaAs, and provide guidelines for the fabrication of
very high quality AlAs 2DESs. We highlight the unprecedented quality of the
fabricated AlAs samples by presenting the magnetotransport data for low density
(~1X1011 cm2) AlAs 2DESs that exhibit high-order fractional quantum Hall
signatures.
"
21766,Study of Clear Sky Models for Singapore,"  The estimation of total solar irradiance falling on the earth's surface is
important in the field of solar energy generation and forecasting. Several
clear-sky solar radiation models have been developed over the last few decades.
Most of these models are based on empirical distribution of various
geographical parameters; while a few models consider various atmospheric
effects in the solar energy estimation. In this paper, we perform a comparative
analysis of several popular clear-sky models, in the tropical region of
Singapore. This is important in countries like Singapore, where we are
primarily focused on reliable and efficient solar energy generation. We analyze
and compare three popular clear-sky models that are widely used in the
literature. We validate our solar estimation results using actual solar
irradiance measurements obtained from collocated weather stations. We finally
conclude the most reliable clear sky model for Singapore, based on all clear
sky days in a year.
"
21767,Multiplicatively closed Markov models must form Lie algebras,"  We prove that the probability substitution matrices obtained from a
continuous-time Markov chain form a multiplicatively closed set if and only if
the rate matrices associated to the chain form a linear space spanning a Lie
algebra. The key original contribution we make is to overcome an obstruction,
due to the presence of inequalities that are unavoidable in the probabilistic
application, that prevents free manipulation of terms in the
Baker-Campbell-Haursdorff formula.
"
21768,Polynomial upper bound on interior Steklov nodal sets,"  We study solutions of uniformly elliptic PDE with Lipschitz leading
coefficients and bounded lower order coefficients. We extend previous results
of A. Logunov concerning nodal sets of harmonic functions and, in particular,
prove polynomial upper bounds on interior nodal sets of Steklov eigenfunctions
in terms of the corresponding eigenvalue $ \lambda $.
"
21769,Multiplicative Normalizing Flows for Variational Bayesian Neural Networks,"  We reinterpret multiplicative noise in neural networks as auxiliary random
variables that augment the approximate posterior in a variational setting for
Bayesian neural networks. We show that through this interpretation it is both
efficient and straightforward to improve the approximation by employing
normalizing flows while still allowing for local reparametrizations and a
tractable lower bound. In experiments we show that with this new approximation
we can significantly improve upon classical mean field for Bayesian neural
networks on both predictive accuracy as well as predictive uncertainty.
"
21770,A categorical semantics for causal structure,"  We present a categorical construction for modelling causal structures within
a general class of process theories that include the theory of classical
probabilistic processes as well as quantum theory. Unlike prior constructions
within categorical quantum mechanics, the objects of this theory encode
fine-grained causal relationships between subsystems and give a new method for
expressing and deriving consequences for a broad class of causal structures. We
show that this framework enables one to define families of processes which are
consistent with arbitrary acyclic causal orderings. In particular, one can
define one-way signalling (a.k.a. semi-causal) processes, non-signalling
processes, and quantum $n$-combs. Furthermore, our framework is general enough
to accommodate recently-proposed generalisations of classical and quantum
theory where processes only need to have a fixed causal ordering locally, but
globally allow indefinite causal ordering.
To illustrate this point, we show that certain processes of this kind, such
as the quantum switch, the process matrices of Oreshkov, Costa, and Brukner,
and a classical three-party example due to Baumeler, Feix, and Wolf are all
instances of a certain family of processes we refer to as $\textrm{SOC}_n$ in
the appropriate category of higher-order causal processes. After defining these
families of causal structures within our framework, we give derivations of
their operational behaviour using simple, diagrammatic axioms.
"
21771,Progressive Learning for Systematic Design of Large Neural Networks,"  We develop an algorithm for systematic design of a large artificial neural
network using a progression property. We find that some non-linear functions,
such as the rectifier linear unit and its derivatives, hold the property. The
systematic design addresses the choice of network size and regularization of
parameters. The number of nodes and layers in network increases in progression
with the objective of consistently reducing an appropriate cost. Each layer is
optimized at a time, where appropriate parameters are learned using convex
optimization. Regularization parameters for convex optimization do not need a
significant manual effort for tuning. We also use random instances for some
weight matrices, and that helps to reduce the number of parameters we learn.
The developed network is expected to show good generalization power due to
appropriate regularization and use of random weights in the layers. This
expectation is verified by extensive experiments for classification and
regression problems, using standard databases.
"
21772,Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for a class of outer measures,"  Closed-form stochastic filtering equations can be derived in a general
setting where probability distributions are replaced by some specific outer
measures. In this article, we study how the principles of the sequential Monte
Carlo method can be adapted for the purpose of practical implementation of
these equations. In particular, we explore how sampling can be used to provide
support points for the approximation of these outer measures. This step enables
practical algorithms to be derived in the spirit of particle filters. The
performance of the obtained algorithms is demonstrated in simulations and their
versatility is illustrated through various examples.
"
21773,Charge-induced force-noise on free-falling test masses: results from LISA Pathfinder,"  We report on electrostatic measurements made on board the European Space
Agency mission LISA Pathfinder. Detailed measurements of the charge-induced
electrostatic forces exerted on free-falling test masses (TMs) inside the
capacitive gravitational reference sensor are the first made in a relevant
environment for a space-based gravitational wave detector. Employing a
combination of charge control and electric-field compensation, we show that the
level of charge-induced acceleration noise on a single TM can be maintained at
a level close to 1.0 fm/s^2/sqrt(Hz) across the 0.1-100 mHz frequency band that
is crucial to an observatory such as LISA. Using dedicated measurements that
detect these effects in the differential acceleration between the two test
masses, we resolve the stochastic nature of the TM charge build up due to
interplanetary cosmic rays and the TM charge-to-force coupling through stray
electric fields in the sensor. All our measurements are in good agreement with
predictions based on a relatively simple electrostatic model of the LISA
Pathfinder instrument.
"
21774,Pseudoholomorphic Maps Relative to Normal Crossings Symplectic Divisors: Compactification,"  Inspired by the log Gromov-Witten theory of Gross-Siebert/Abramovich-Chen, we
introduce a geometric notion of log pseudoholomorphic map relative to simple
normal crossings symplectic divisors defined in [9]. For certain almost complex
structures, we show that the moduli space of stable log pseudoholomorphic maps
of any fixed type is compact and metrizable with respect to an enhancement of
the Gromov topology. In the case of smooth symplectic divisors, our
compactification is often smaller than the relative compactification and there
is a projection map from the former onto the latter. The latter is constructed
via expanded degenerations of the target. Our construction does not need any
modification of (or any extra structure on) the target. Unlike the classical
moduli spaces of stable maps, these log moduli spaces are often virtually
singular. We describe an explicit toric model for the normal cone to each
stratum in terms of the defining combinatorial data of that stratum. In
upcoming papers, we will define a natural Fredholm operator which gives us the
deformation/obstruction spaces of each stratum and prove a gluing theorem for
smoothing log maps in the normal direction to each stratum. With minor
modifications to the theory of Kuranishi structures, the latter would allow us
to construct a virtual fundamental class for every such log moduli space.
"
21775,Improving Efficiency in Convolutional Neural Network with Multilinear Filters,"  The excellent performance of deep neural networks has enabled us to solve
several automatization problems, opening an era of autonomous devices. However,
current deep net architectures are heavy with millions of parameters and
require billions of floating point operations. Several works have been
developed to compress a pre-trained deep network to reduce memory footprint
and, possibly, computation. Instead of compressing a pre-trained network, in
this work, we propose a generic neural network layer structure employing
multilinear projection as the primary feature extractor. The proposed
architecture requires several times less memory as compared to the traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), while inherits the similar design
principles of a CNN. In addition, the proposed architecture is equipped with
two computation schemes that enable computation reduction or scalability.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of our compact projection that
outperforms traditional CNN, while requiring far fewer parameters.
"
21776,Combinatorial Penalties: Which structures are preserved by convex relaxations?,"  We consider the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous convex relaxations for
combinatorial penalty functions defined on support sets. Our study identifies
key differences in the tightness of the resulting relaxations through the
notion of the lower combinatorial envelope of a set-function along with new
necessary conditions for support identification. We then propose a general
adaptive estimator for convex monotone regularizers, and derive new sufficient
conditions for support recovery in the asymptotic setting.
"
21777,Multispecies fruit flower detection using a refined semantic segmentation network,"  In fruit production, critical crop management decisions are guided by bloom
intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in an orchard. Despite its
importance, bloom intensity is still typically estimated by means of human
visual inspection. Existing automated computer vision systems for flower
identification are based on hand-engineered techniques that work only under
specific conditions and with limited performance. This work proposes an
automated technique for flower identification that is robust to uncontrolled
environments and applicable to different flower species. Our method relies on
an end-to-end residual convolutional neural network (CNN) that represents the
state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. To enhance its sensitivity to
flowers, we fine-tune this network using a single dataset of apple flower
images. Since CNNs tend to produce coarse segmentations, we employ a refinement
method to better distinguish between individual flower instances. Without any
pre-processing or dataset-specific training, experimental results on images of
apple, peach and pear flowers, acquired under different conditions demonstrate
the robustness and broad applicability of our method.
"
21778,Mobile phone records to feed activity-based travel demand models: MATSim for studying a cordon toll policy in Barcelona,"  Activity-based models appeared as an answer to the limitations of the
traditional trip-based and tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental
assumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from
people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent
representation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing,
and microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential
to simulate traffic demand management policies, their practical application is
still limited. One of the main reasons is that these models require a huge
amount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the
pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The
work presented here has a twofold objective: first, to demonstrate the
capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based transport models,
and, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to
estimate the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries
for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone
records. This information is then employed as input for building a transport
MATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves
the quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon
toll policy applied to two different areas of the city and at different times
of the day is then studied. Our results show the way in which the modal share
is modified in each of the considered scenario. The possibility of evaluating
the effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with
the ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area
confirm the advantages of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic
demand management policies.
"
21779,Gate Activation Signal Analysis for Gated Recurrent Neural Networks and Its Correlation with Phoneme Boundaries,"  In this paper we analyze the gate activation signals inside the gated
recurrent neural networks, and find the temporal structure of such signals is
highly correlated with the phoneme boundaries. This correlation is further
verified by a set of experiments for phoneme segmentation, in which better
results compared to standard approaches were obtained.
"
21780,Fully Convolutional Grasp Detection Network with Oriented Anchor Box,"  In this paper, we present a real-time approach to predict multiple grasping
poses for a parallel-plate robotic gripper using RGB images. A model with
oriented anchor box mechanism is proposed and a new matching strategy is used
during the training process. An end-to-end fully convolutional neural network
is employed in our work. The network consists of two parts: the feature
extractor and multi-grasp predictor. The feature extractor is a deep
convolutional neural network. The multi-grasp predictor regresses grasp
rectangles from predefined oriented rectangles, called oriented anchor boxes,
and classifies the rectangles into graspable and ungraspable. On the standard
Cornell Grasp Dataset, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.74% and 96.61% on
image-wise split and object-wise split respectively, and outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art approach by 1.74% on image-wise split and 0.51% on object-wise
split.
"
21781,Wetting States of Two-Dimensional Drops under Gravity,"  An analytical model is proposed for the Young-Laplace equation of
two-dimensional (2D) drops under gravity. Inspired by the pioneering work of
Landau & Lifshitz (1987), we derive analytical expressions of the profile of
drops on flat surfaces, for arbitrary contact angles and drop volume. We then
extend our theory for drops on inclined surfaces and reveal that the contact
line plays a key role on the wetting state of the drops: (1) when the contact
line is completely pinning, the advancing and receding contact angles and the
shape of the drop can be uniquely determined by the predefined droplet volume,
sliding angle and contact area, which does not rely on the Young contact angle;
(2) when the drop has a movable contact line, it would achieve a wetting state
with a minimum free energy resulting from the competition between the surface
tension and gravity. Our theory is in excellent agreement with numerical
results.
"
21782,Polarity-tunable magnetic tunnel junctions based on ferromagnetism at oxide heterointerfaces,"  Complex oxide systems have attracted considerable attention because of their
fascinating properties, including the magnetic ordering at the conducting
interface between two band insulators, such as LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO).
However, the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom at the LAO/STO
heterointerface has remained elusive. Here, we have fabricated hybrid magnetic
tunnel junctions consisting of Co and LAO/STO ferromagnets with the insertion
of a Ti layer in between, which clearly exhibit magnetic switching and the
tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect below 10 K. The magnitude and the of
the TMR are strongly dependent on the direction of the rotational magnetic
field parallel to the LAO/STO plane, which is attributed to a strong
Rashba-type spin orbit coupling in the LAO/STO heterostructure. Our study
provides a further support for the existence of the macroscopic ferromagnetism
at LAO/STO heterointerfaces and opens a novel route to realize interfacial
spintronics devices.
"
21783,Pair-breaking of multi-gap superconductivity under parallel magnetic fields in electric-field-induced surface metallic state,"  Roles of paramagnetic and diamagnetic pair-breaking effects in
superconductivity in electric-field-induced surface metallic state are studied
by Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, when magnetic fields are applied parallel to
the surface. The multi-gap states of sub-bands are related to the depth
dependence and the magnetic field dependence of superconductivity. In the
Fermi-energy density of states and the spin density, sub-band contributions
successively appear from higher-level sub-bands with increasing magnetic
fields. The characteristic magnetic field dependence may be a key feature to
identify the multi-gap structure of the surface superconductivity.
"
21784,A Lottery Model for Center-type Problems With Outliers,"  In this paper, we give tight approximation algorithms for the $k$-center and
matroid center problems with outliers. Unfairness arises naturally in this
setting: certain clients could always be considered as outliers. To address
this issue, we introduce a lottery model in which each client $j$ is allowed to
submit a parameter $p_j \in [0,1]$ and we look for a random solution that
covers every client $j$ with probability at least $p_j$. Our techniques include
a randomized rounding procedure to round a point inside a matroid intersection
polytope to a basis plus at most one extra item such that all marginal
probabilities are preserved and such that a certain linear function of the
variables does not decrease in the process with probability one.
"
21785,Exact solutions in two-dimensional topological superconductors: Hubbard interaction induced spontaneous symmetry breaking,"  We present an exactly solvable model of a spin-triplet $f$-wave topological
superconductor on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of the Hubbard
interaction for arbitrary interaction strength. First we show that the
Kane-Mele model with the corresponding spin-triplet $f$-wave superconducting
pairings becomes a full-gap topological superconductor possessing the
time-reversal symmetry. We then introduce the Hubbard interaction. The exactly
solvable condition is found to be the emergence of perfect flat bands at zero
energy. They generate infinitely many conserved quantities. It is intriguing
that the Hubbard interaction breaks the time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.
As a result, the system turns into a trivial superconductor. We demonstrate
this topological property based on the topological number and by analyzing the
edge state in nanoribbon geometry.
"
21786,Seymour's second neighbourhood conjecture for quasi-transitive oriented graphs,"  Seymour's second neighbourhood conjecture asserts that every oriented graph
has a vertex whose second out-neighbourhood is at least as large as its
out-neighbourhood. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture holds for
quasi-transitive oriented graphs, which is a superclass of tournaments and
transitive acyclic digraphs. A digraph $D$ is called quasi-transitive is for
every pair $xy,yz$ of arcs between distinct vertices $x,y,z$, $xz$ or $zx$
(""or"" is inclusive here) is in $D$.
"
21787,Analyzing the network structure and gender differences among the members of the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) community,"  In this paper, we analyze a major part of the research output of the
Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) community in the period 2000 to
2016 from a network analytical perspective. We focus on the papers presented at
the European and U.S. NKOS workshops and in addition four special issues on
NKOS in the last 16 years. For this purpose, we have generated an open dataset,
the ""NKOS bibliography"" which covers the bibliographic information of the
research output. We analyze the co-authorship network of this community which
results in 123 papers with a sum of 256 distinct authors. We use standard
network analytic measures such as degree, betweenness and closeness centrality
to describe the co-authorship network of the NKOS dataset. First, we
investigate global properties of the network over time. Second, we analyze the
centrality of the authors in the NKOS network. Lastly, we investigate gender
differences in collaboration behavior in this community. Our results show that
apart from differences in centrality measures of the scholars, they have higher
tendency to collaborate with those in the same institution or the same
geographic proximity. We also find that homophily is higher among women in this
community. Apart from small differences in closeness and clustering among men
and women, we do not find any significant dissimilarities with respect to other
centralities.
"
21788,On a new closed formula for the solution of second order linear difference equations and applications,"  In this note, we establish a new closed formula for the solution of
homogeneous second-order linear difference equations with constant coefficients
by using matrix theory. This, in turn, gives new closed formulas concerning all
sequences of this type such as the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences. As
applications; we show that Binet's formula, in this case, is valid for negative
integers as well. Finally, we find new summation formulas relating the elements
of such sequences.
"
21789,Flat bands in lattices with non-Hermitian coupling,"  We study non-Hermitian photonic lattices that exhibit competition between
conservative and non-Hermitian (gain/loss) couplings. A bipartite sublattice
symmetry enforces the existence of non-Hermitian flat bands, which are
typically embedded in an auxiliary dispersive band and give rise to
non-diffracting ""compact localized states"". Band crossings take the form of
non-Hermitian degeneracies known as exceptional points. Excitations of the
lattice can produce either diffracting or amplifying behaviors. If the
non-Hermitian coupling is fine-tuned to generate an effective $\pi$ flux, the
lattice spectrum becomes completely flat, a non-Hermitian analogue of
Aharonov-Bohm caging in which the magnetic field is replaced by balanced gain
and loss. When the effective flux is zero, the non-Hermitian band crossing
points give rise to asymmetric diffraction and anomalous linear amplification.
"
21790,An ultra-sensitive and wideband magnetometer based on a superconducting quantum interference device,"  The magnetic field noise in superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQUIDs) used for biomagnetic research such as magnetoencephalography or
ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance is usually limited by instrumental
dewar noise. We constructed a wideband, ultra-low noise system with a 45 mm
diameter superconducting pick-up coil inductively coupled to a current sensor
SQUID. Thermal noise in the liquid helium dewar is minimized by using
aluminized polyester fabric as superinsulation and aluminum oxide strips as
heat shields, respectively. With a magnetometer pick-up coil in the center of
the Berlin magneti- cally shielded room 2 (BMSR2) a noise level of around 150
aT Hz$^{-1/2}$ is achieved in the white noise regime between about 20 kHz and
the system bandwidth of about 2.5 MHz. At lower frequencies, the resolution is
limited by magnetic field noise arising from the walls of the shielded room.
Modeling the BMSR2 as a closed cube with continuous \mu-metal walls we can
quantitatively reproduce its measured field noise.
"
21791,Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part I): Data-driven Solutions of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations,"  We introduce physics informed neural networks -- neural networks that are
trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given law of
physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this
two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two
main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of
partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the
available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous
time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class
of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any
underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we
demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial
differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are
fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.
"
21792,Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL 2017),"  The large scale of scholarly publications poses a challenge for scholars in
information seeking and sensemaking. Bibliometrics, information retrieval (IR),
text mining and NLP techniques could help in these search and look-up
activities, but are not yet widely used. This workshop is intended to stimulate
IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches
in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, text
mining and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in
scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The BIRNDL
workshop at SIGIR 2017 will incorporate an invited talk, paper sessions and the
third edition of the Computational Linguistics (CL) Scientific Summarization
Shared Task.
"
21793,Dimension free $L^p$-bounds of maximal functions associated to products of Euclidean balls,"  A few years ago, Bourgain proved that the centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal
function for the cube has dimension free $L^p$-bounds for $p>1$. We extend his
result to products of Euclidean balls of different dimensions. In addition, we
provide dimension free $L^p$-bounds for the maximal function associated to
products of Euclidean spheres for $p > \frac{N}{N-1}$ and $N \ge 3$, where
$N-1$ is the lowest occurring dimension of a single sphere. The aforementioned
result is obtained from the latter one by applying the method of rotations from
Stein's pioneering work on the spherical maximal function.
"
21794,Pulling in models of cell migration,"  There are numerous scenarios in which populations of cells migrate in crowded
environments. Typical examples include wound healing, cancer growth and embryo
development. In these crowded environments cells are able to interact with each
other in a variety of ways. These include excluded volume interactions,
adhesion, repulsion, cell signalling, pushing and pulling. One popular way to
understand the behaviour of a group of interacting cells is through an
agent-based model (ABM). A typical aim of modellers using such represtations is
to elucidate how the microscopic interactions at the cell-level impact on the
macroscopic behaviour of the population. The complex cell-cell interactions
listed above have also been incorporated into such models; all apart from
cell-cell pulling. In this paper we consider this under-represented cell-cell
interaction, in which an active cell is able to `pull' a nearby neighbour as it
moves. We incorporate a variety of potential cell-cell pulling mechanisms into
on- and off-lattice agent-based volume exclusion models of cell movement. For
each of these agent-based models we derive a continuum partial differential
equation which describes the evolution of the cells at a population-level. We
study the agreement between the ABMs and the continuum, population-based
models, and compare and contrast a range of ABMs (accounting for the different
pulling mechanisms) with each other. We find generally good agreement between
the ABMs and the corresponding continuum models that worsens as the agent-based
models become more complex. Interestingly, we observe that the partial
differential equations that we derive differ significantly, depending on
whether they were derived from on- or off-lattice ABMs of pulling. This hints
that it is important employ the appropriate ABM when representing pulling
cell-cell interactions.

21795,Spatially - resolved study of the Meissner effect in superconductors using NV-centers-in-diamond optical magnetometry,"  Non-invasive magnetic field sensing using optically - detected magnetic
resonance of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond was used to study spatial
distribution of the magnetic induction upon penetration and expulsion of weak
magnetic fields in several representative superconductors. Vector magnetic
fields were measured on the surface of conventional, Pb and Nb, and
unconventional, LuNi$_2$B$_2$C, Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$,
Ba(Fe$_{0.93}$Co$_{0.07}$)$_2$As$_2$, and CaKFe$_4$As$_4$, superconductors,
with diffraction - limited spatial resolution using variable - temperature
confocal system. Magnetic induction profiles across the crystal edges were
measured in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) conditions. While all
superconductors show nearly perfect screening of magnetic fields applied after
cooling to temperatures well below the superconducting transition, $T_c$, a
range of very different behaviors was observed for Meissner expulsion upon
cooling in static magnetic field from above $T_c$. Substantial conventional
Meissner expulsion is found in LuNi$_2$B$_2$C, paramagnetic Meissner effect
(PME) is found in Nb, and virtually no expulsion is observed in iron-based
superconductors. In all cases, good correlation with macroscopic measurements
of total magnetic moment is found. Our measurements of the spatial distribution
of magnetic induction provide insight into microscopic physics of the Meissner
effect.

21796,A magnetic skyrmion as a non-linear resistive element - a potential building block for reservoir computing,"  Inspired by the human brain, there is a strong effort to find alternative
models of information processing capable of imitating the high energy
efficiency of neuromorphic information processing. One possible realization of
cognitive computing are reservoir computing networks. These networks are built
out of non-linear resistive elements which are recursively connected. We
propose that a skyrmion network embedded in frustrated magnetic films may
provide a suitable physical implementation for reservoir computing
applications. The significant key ingredient of such a network is a
two-terminal device with non-linear voltage characteristics originating from
single-layer magnetoresistive effects, like the anisotropic magnetoresistance
or the recently discovered non-collinear magnetoresistance. The most basic
element for a reservoir computing network built from ""skyrmion fabrics"" is a
single skyrmion embedded in a ferromagnetic ribbon. In order to pave the way
towards reservoir computing systems based on skyrmion fabrics, here we simulate
and analyze i) the current flow through a single magnetic skyrmion due to the
anisotropic magneto-resistive effect and ii) the combined physics of local
pinning and the anisotropic magneto-resistive effect.
"
21797,Bayesian optimal designs for dose-response curves with common parameters,"  The issue of determining not only an adequate dose but also a dosing
frequency of a drug arises frequently in Phase II clinical trials. This results
in the comparison of models which have some parameters in common. Planning such
studies based on Bayesian optimal designs offers robustness to our conclusions
since these designs, unlike locally optimal designs, are efficient even if the
parameters are misspecified. In this paper we develop approximate design theory
for Bayesian $D$-optimality for nonlinear regression models with common
parameters and investigate the cases of common location or common location and
scale parameters separately. Analytical characterisations of saturated Bayesian
$D$-optimal designs are derived for frequently used dose-response models and
the advantages of our results are illustrated via a numerical investigation.
"
21798,3D Consistent & Robust Segmentation of Cardiac Images by Deep Learning with Spatial Propagation,"  We propose a method based on deep learning to perform cardiac segmentation on
short axis MRI image stacks iteratively from the top slice (around the base) to
the bottom slice (around the apex). At each iteration, a novel variant of U-net
is applied to propagate the segmentation of a slice to the adjacent slice below
it. In other words, the prediction of a segmentation of a slice is dependent
upon the already existing segmentation of an adjacent slice. 3D-consistency is
hence explicitly enforced. The method is trained on a large database of 3078
cases from UK Biobank. It is then tested on 756 different cases from UK Biobank
and three other state-of-the-art cohorts (ACDC with 100 cases, Sunnybrook with
30 cases, RVSC with 16 cases). Results comparable or even better than the
state-of-the-art in terms of distance measures are achieved. They also
emphasize the assets of our method, namely enhanced spatial consistency
(currently neither considered nor achieved by the state-of-the-art), and the
generalization ability to unseen cases even from other databases.
"
21799,"A Fast Method to Calculate Kendall Correlations of Large, Sparse Spike Trains","  Despite the fact that the Kendall correlation is becoming recognized as an
important tool in neuroscience, most standard algorithms to compute the Kendall
correlation of large spike trains are computationally very slow. Here we
present a new, significantly faster method for calculating the Kendall
correlation of spike trains that takes advantage of their structure. We show
that our method is more than 300 times faster than traditional approaches for
particularly large, sparse spike trains, and still more than 10 times faster
for large, but considerably less sparse, spike trains. A MATLAB function
executing the method described here was made freely available on-line.
"
21800,On-the-Fly Adaptation of Regression Forests for Online Camera Relocalisation,"  Camera relocalisation is an important problem in computer vision, with
applications in simultaneous localisation and mapping, virtual/augmented
reality and navigation. Common techniques either match the current image
against keyframes with known poses coming from a tracker, or establish 2D-to-3D
correspondences between keypoints in the current image and points in the scene
in order to estimate the camera pose. Recently, regression forests have become
a popular alternative to establish such correspondences. They achieve accurate
results, but must be trained offline on the target scene, preventing
relocalisation in new environments. In this paper, we show how to circumvent
this limitation by adapting a pre-trained forest to a new scene on the fly. Our
adapted forests achieve relocalisation performance that is on par with that of
offline forests, and our approach runs in under 150ms, making it desirable for
real-time systems that require online relocalisation.
"
21801,High-Kinetic Inductance Additive Manufactured Superconducting Microwave Cavity,"  Investigations into the microwave surface impedance of superconducting
resonators have led to the development of single photon counters that rely on
kinetic inductance for their operation. While concurrent progress in additive
manufacturing, `3D printing', opens up a previously inaccessible design space
for waveguide resonators. In this manuscript, we present results from the first
synthesis of these two technologies in a titanium, aluminum, vanadium
(Ti-6Al-4V) superconducting radio frequency resonator which exploits a design
unattainable through conventional fabrication means. We find that Ti-6Al-4V has
two distinct superconducting transition temperatures observable in heat
capacity measurements. The higher transition temperature is in agreement with
DC resistance measurements. While the lower transition temperature, not
previously known in literature, is consistent with the observed temperature
dependence of the superconducting microwave surface impedance. From the surface
reactance, we extract a London penetration depth of $8\pm3{\mu}$m - roughly an
order of magnitude larger than other titanium alloys and several orders of
magnitude larger than other conventional elemental superconductors. This large
London penetration depth suggests that Ti-6Al-4V may be a suitable material for
high kinetic inductance applications such as single photon counting or
parametric amplification used in quantum computing.
"
21802,Known Boundary Emulation of Complex Computer Models,"  Computer models are now widely used across a range of scientific disciplines
to describe various complex physical systems, however to perform full
uncertainty quantification we often need to employ emulators. An emulator is a
fast statistical construct that mimics the complex computer model, and greatly
aids the vastly more computationally intensive uncertainty quantification
calculations that a serious scientific analysis often requires. In some cases,
the complex model can be solved far more efficiently for certain parameter
settings, leading to boundaries or hyperplanes in the input parameter space
where the model is essentially known. We show that for a large class of
Gaussian process style emulators, multiple boundaries can be formally
incorporated into the emulation process, by Bayesian updating of the emulators
with respect to the boundaries, for trivial computational cost. The resulting
updated emulator equations are given analytically. This leads to emulators that
possess increased accuracy across large portions of the input parameter space.
We also describe how a user can incorporate such boundaries within standard
black box GP emulation packages that are currently available, without altering
the core code. Appropriate designs of model runs in the presence of known
boundaries are then analysed, with two kinds of general purpose designs
proposed. We then apply the improved emulation and design methodology to an
important systems biology model of hormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis Thaliana.
"
21803,Investigating the role of musical genre in human perception of music stretching resistance,"  To stretch a music piece to a given length is a common demand in people's
daily lives, e.g., in audio-video synchronization and animation production.
However, it is not always guaranteed that the stretched music piece is
acceptable for general audience since music stretching suffers from people's
perceptual artefacts. Over-stretching a music piece will make it uncomfortable
for human psychoacoustic hearing. The research on music stretching resistance
attempts to estimate the maximum stretchability of music pieces to further
avoid over-stretch. It has been observed that musical genres can significantly
improve the accuracy of automatic estimation of music stretching resistance,
but how musical genres are related to music stretching resistance has never
been explained or studied in detail in the literature. In this paper, the
characteristics of music stretching resistance are compared across different
musical genres. It is found that music stretching resistance has strong
intra-genre cohesiveness and inter-genre discrepancies in the experiments.
Moreover, the ambiguity and the symmetry of music stretching resistance are
also observed in the experimental analysis. These findings lead to a new
measurement on the similarity between different musical genres based on their
music stretching resistance. In addition, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) also
supports the findings in this paper by verifying the significance of musical
genre in shaping music stretching resistance.
"
21804,Emerging Market Corporate Bonds as First-to-Default Baskets,"  Emerging market hard-currency bonds are an asset class of growing importance,
and contain exposure to an EM sovereign and the underlying industry. The
authors investigate how to model this as a modification of the well-known
first-to-default (FtD) basket, using the structural model, and find the
approach feasible.
"
21805,Fabrication of plasmonic surface relief gratings for the application of band-pass filter in UV-Visible spectral range,"  The measured experimental results of optical diffraction of 10, 5 and 3.4
micrometer period plasmonic surface relief grating are presented for the
application of band-pass filter in visible spectral range. Conventional
scanning electron microscopic (SEM) is used to fabricate the grating structures
on the silver halide based film (substrate) by exposing the electron beam in
raster scan fashion. Morphological characterization of the gratings is
performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the period, height and
profile depends on the line per frame, beam spot, single line dwell time, beam
current, and accelerating voltage of the electron beam. Optical transmission
spectra of 10 micrometer period grating shows a well-defined localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) dip at ~366 nm wavelength corresponding to gelatin
embedded silver nanoparticles of the grating structure. As the period of the
grating reduces LSPR dip becomes prominent. The maximum first order diffraction
efficiency (DE) and bandwidth for 10 micrometer period grating are observed as
4% and 400 nm in 350 nm to 800 nm wavelength range respectively. The DE and
bandwidth are reduced up to 0.03% and 100 nm for 3.4 micrometer period grating.
The profile of DE is significantly flat within the diffraction bandwidth for
each of the gratings. An assessment of the particular role of LSPR absorption
and varied grating period in the development of the profile of first order DE
v/s wavelength are studied. Fabrication of such nano-scale structures in a
large area using conventional SEM and silver halide based films may provide the
simple and efficient technique for various optical devices applications.
"
21806,Metrics On $S^2$ With Bounded $\|K_g\|_{L^1\log L^1}$ And Small $\|K_g-1\|_{L^1}$,"  In this short paper, we will study the convergence of a metric sequence $g_k$
on $S^2$ with bounded $\int|K_{g_k}|\log(1+|K_{g_k}|)d\mu_{g_k}$ and small
$\int|K(g_k)-1\|d\mu_{g_k}$. We will show that such a sequence is precompact.
"
21807,Light traffic behavior under the power-of-two load balancing strategy: The case of heterogeneous servers,"  We consider a multi-server queueing system under the power-of-two policy with
Poisson job arrivals, heterogeneous servers and a general job requirement
distribution; each server operates under the first-come first-serve policy and
there are no buffer constraints. We analyze the performance of this system in
light traffic by evaluating the first two light traffic derivatives of the
average job response time. These expressions point to several interesting
structural features associated with server heterogeneity in light traffic: For
unequal capacities, the average job response time is seen to decrease for small
values of the arrival rate, and the more diverse the server speeds, the greater
the gain in performance. These theoretical findings are assessed through
limited simulations.
"
21808,Deep Learning with Dynamic Computation Graphs,"  Neural networks that compute over graph structures are a natural fit for
problems in a variety of domains, including natural language (parse trees) and
cheminformatics (molecular graphs). However, since the computation graph has a
different shape and size for every input, such networks do not directly support
batched training or inference. They are also difficult to implement in popular
deep learning libraries, which are based on static data-flow graphs. We
introduce a technique called dynamic batching, which not only batches together
operations between different input graphs of dissimilar shape, but also between
different nodes within a single input graph. The technique allows us to create
static graphs, using popular libraries, that emulate dynamic computation graphs
of arbitrary shape and size. We further present a high-level library of
compositional blocks that simplifies the creation of dynamic graph models.
Using the library, we demonstrate concise and batch-wise parallel
implementations for a variety of models from the literature.
"
21809,Requirements for Secure Clock Synchronization,"  This paper establishes a fundamental theory of secure clock synchronization.
Accurate clock synchronization is the backbone of systems managing power
distribution, financial transactions, telecommunication operations, database
services, etc. Some clock synchronization (time transfer) systems, such as the
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), are based on one-way communication
from a master to a slave clock. Others, such as the Network Transport Protocol
(NTP), and the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), involve two-way
communication between the master and slave. This paper shows that all one-way
time transfer protocols are vulnerable to replay attacks that can potentially
compromise timing information. A set of conditions for secure two-way clock
synchronization is proposed and proved to be necessary and sufficient. It is
shown that IEEE 1588 PTP, although a two-way synchronization protocol, is not
compliant with these conditions, and is therefore insecure. Requirements for
secure IEEE 1588 PTP are proposed, and a second example protocol is offered to
illustrate the range of compliant systems.
"
21810,Stability of fractional-order nonlinear systems by Lyapunov direct method,"  In this paper, by using a characterization of functions having fractional
derivative, we propose a rigorous fractional Lyapunov function candidate method
to analyze stability of fractional-order nonlinear systems. First, we prove an
inequality concerning the fractional derivatives of convex Lyapunov functions
without the assumption on the existence of derivative of pseudo-states. Second,
we establish fractional Lyapunov functions to fractional-order systems without
the assumption on the global existence of solutions. Our theorems fill the gaps
and strengthen results in some existing papers.
"
21811,Scaling laws during collapse of a homopolymer: Lattice versus off-lattice,"  We present comparative results from simulations of a lattice and an
off-lattice model of a homopolymer, in the context of kinetics of the collapse
transition. Scaling laws related to the collapse time, cluster coarsening and
aging behavior are compared. Although in both models the cluster growth is
independent of temperature, the related exponents turn out to be different.
Conversely, the aging and associated scaling properties are found to be
universal, with the nonequilibrium autocorrelation exponent obeying a recently
derived bound.
"
21812,Efficient Convex Optimization with Membership Oracles,"  We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex set
given access only to an evaluation oracle for the function and a membership
oracle for the set. We give a simple algorithm which solves this problem with
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$ oracle calls and $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ additional arithmetic
operations. Using this result, we obtain more efficient reductions among the
five basic oracles for convex sets and functions defined by Grötschel, Lovasz
and Schrijver.
"
21813,On the Prime Graph Question for Integral Group Rings of Conway simple groups,"  The Prime Graph Question for integral group rings asks if it is true that if
the normalized unit group of the integral group ring of a finite group $G$
contains an element of order $pq$, for some primes $p$ and $q$, also $G$
contains an element of that order. We answer this question for the three Conway
sporadic simple groups after reducing it to a combinatorial question about
Young tableaus and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This finishes work of V.
Bovdi, A. Konovalov and S. Linton.
"
21814,Challenges in Data-to-Document Generation,"  Recent neural models have shown significant progress on the problem of
generating short descriptive texts conditioned on a small number of database
records. In this work, we suggest a slightly more difficult data-to-text
generation task, and investigate how effective current approaches are on this
task. In particular, we introduce a new, large-scale corpus of data records
paired with descriptive documents, propose a series of extractive evaluation
methods for analyzing performance, and obtain baseline results using current
neural generation methods. Experiments show that these models produce fluent
text, but fail to convincingly approximate human-generated documents. Moreover,
even templated baselines exceed the performance of these neural models on some
metrics, though copy- and reconstruction-based extensions lead to noticeable
improvements.
"
21815,The covering type of closed surfaces and minimal triangulations,"  The notion of covering type was recently introduced by Karoubi and Weibel to
measure the complexity of a topological space by means of good coverings. When
X has the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex, its covering type coincides
with the minimum possible number of vertices of a simplicial complex homotopy
equivalent to X. In this article we compute the covering type of all closed
surfaces. Our results completely settle a problem posed by Karoubi and Weibel,
and shed more light on the relationship between the topology of surfaces and
the number of vertices of minimal triangulations from a homotopy point of view.
"
21816,Relaxation heuristics for the set multicover problem with generalized upper bound constraints,"  We consider an extension of the set covering problem (SCP) introducing
(i)~multicover and (ii)~generalized upper bound (GUB)~constraints. For the
conventional SCP, the pricing method has been introduced to reduce the size of
instances, and several efficient heuristic algorithms based on such reduction
techniques have been developed to solve large-scale instances. However, GUB
constraints often make the pricing method less effective, because they often
prevent solutions from containing highly evaluated variables together. To
overcome this problem, we develop heuristic algorithms to reduce the size of
instances, in which new evaluation schemes of variables are introduced taking
account of GUB constraints. We also develop an efficient implementation of a
2-flip neighborhood local search algorithm that reduces the number of
candidates in the neighborhood without sacrificing the solution quality. In
order to guide the search to visit a wide variety of good solutions, we also
introduce a path relinking method that generates new solutions by combining two
or more solutions obtained so far. According to computational comparison on
benchmark instances, the proposed method succeeds in selecting a small number
of promising variables properly and performs quite effectively even for
large-scale instances having hard GUB constraints.
"
21817,Optimal percolation on multiplex networks,"  Optimal percolation is the problem of finding the minimal set of nodes such
that if the members of this set are removed from a network, the network is
fragmented into non-extensive disconnected clusters. The solution of the
optimal percolation problem has direct applicability in strategies of
immunization in disease spreading processes, and influence maximization for
certain classes of opinion dynamical models. In this paper, we consider the
problem of optimal percolation on multiplex networks. The multiplex scenario
serves to realistically model various technological, biological, and social
networks. We find that the multilayer nature of these systems, and more
precisely multiplex characteristics such as edge overlap and interlayer
degree-degree correlation, profoundly changes the properties of the set of
nodes identified as the solution of the optimal percolation problem.
"
21818,Nearly Spectral Spaces,"  We study some natural generalizations of the spectral spaces in the contexts
of commutative rings and distributive lattices. We obtain a topological
characterization for the spectra of commutative (not necessarily unitary) rings
and we find spectral versions for the up-spectral and down-spectral spaces. We
show that the duality between distributive lattices and Balbes-Dwinger spaces
is the co-equivalence associated to a pair of contravariant right adjoint
functors between suitable categories.
"
21819,Speeding Up Latent Variable Gaussian Graphical Model Estimation via Nonconvex Optimizations,"  We study the estimation of the latent variable Gaussian graphical model
(LVGGM), where the precision matrix is the superposition of a sparse matrix and
a low-rank matrix. In order to speed up the estimation of the sparse plus
low-rank components, we propose a sparsity constrained maximum likelihood
estimator based on matrix factorization, and an efficient alternating gradient
descent algorithm with hard thresholding to solve it. Our algorithm is orders
of magnitude faster than the convex relaxation based methods for LVGGM. In
addition, we prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the
unknown sparse and low-rank components up to the optimal statistical precision.
Experiments on both synthetic and genomic data demonstrate the superiority of
our algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms and corroborate our theory.
"
21820,The third data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey and associated data products,"  The Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) is an ongoing optical wide-field imaging survey
with the OmegaCAM camera at the VLT Survey Telescope. It aims to image 1500
square degrees in four filters (ugri). The core science driver is mapping the
large-scale matter distribution in the Universe, using weak lensing shear and
photometric redshift measurements. Further science cases include galaxy
evolution, Milky Way structure, detection of high-redshift clusters, and
finding rare sources such as strong lenses and quasars. Here we present the
third public data release (DR3) and several associated data products, adding
further area, homogenized photometric calibration, photometric redshifts and
weak lensing shear measurements to the first two releases. A dedicated pipeline
embedded in the Astro-WISE information system is used for the production of the
main release. Modifications with respect to earlier releases are described in
detail. Photometric redshifts have been derived using both Bayesian template
fitting, and machine-learning techniques. For the weak lensing measurements,
optimized procedures based on the THELI data reduction and lensfit shear
measurement packages are used. In DR3 stacked ugri images, weight maps, masks,
and source lists for 292 new survey tiles (~300 sq.deg) are made available. The
multi-band catalogue, including homogenized photometry and photometric
redshifts, covers the combined DR1, DR2 and DR3 footprint of 440 survey tiles
(447 sq.deg). Limiting magnitudes are typically 24.3, 25.1, 24.9, 23.8 (5 sigma
in a 2 arcsec aperture) in ugri, respectively, and the typical r-band PSF size
is less than 0.7 arcsec. The photometric homogenization scheme ensures accurate
colors and an absolute calibration stable to ~2% for gri and ~3% in u.
Separately released are a weak lensing shear catalogue and photometric
redshifts based on two different machine-learning techniques.
"
21821,Hydrogen Line Observations of Cometary Spectra at 1420 Mhz,"  In 2016, the Center for Planetary Science proposed a hypothesis arguing a
comet and/or its hydrogen cloud were a strong candidate for the source of the
Wow! Signal. From 27 November 2016 to 24 February 2017, the Center for
Planetary Science conducted 200 observations in the radio spectrum to validate
the hypothesis. The investigation discovered that comet 266/P Christensen
emitted a radio signal at 1420.25 MHz. The results of this investigation,
therefore, conclude that cometary spectra are detectable at 1420 MHz and, more
importantly, that the 1977 Wow! Signal was a natural phenomenon from a Solar
System body.
"
21822,Pain-Free Random Differential Privacy with Sensitivity Sampling,"  Popular approaches to differential privacy, such as the Laplace and
exponential mechanisms, calibrate randomised smoothing through global
sensitivity of the target non-private function. Bounding such sensitivity is
often a prohibitively complex analytic calculation. As an alternative, we
propose a straightforward sampler for estimating sensitivity of non-private
mechanisms. Since our sensitivity estimates hold with high probability, any
mechanism that would be $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private under
bounded global sensitivity automatically achieves
$(\epsilon,\delta,\gamma)$-random differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012),
without any target-specific calculations required. We demonstrate on worked
example learners how our usable approach adopts a naturally-relaxed privacy
guarantee, while achieving more accurate releases even for non-private
functions that are black-box computer programs.
"
21823,Extremal Kaehler-Einstein metric for two-dimensional convex bodies,"  Given a convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with the barycenter at the
origin we consider the corresponding K{ä}hler-Einstein equation $e^{-\Phi} =
\det D^2 \Phi$. If $K$ is a simplex, then the Ricci tensor of the Hessian
metric $D^2 \Phi$ is constant and equals $\frac{n-1}{4(n+1)}$. We conjecture
that the Ricci tensor of $D^2 \Phi$ for arbitrary $K$ is uniformly bounded by
$\frac{n-1}{4(n+1)}$ and verify this conjecture in the two-dimensional case.
The general case remains open.
"
21824,Socio-spatial Self-organizing Maps: Using Social Media to Assess Relevant Geographies for Exposure to Social Processes,"  Social media offers a unique window into attitudes like racism and
homophobia, exposure to which are important, hard to measure and understudied
social determinants of health. However, individual geo-located observations
from social media are noisy and geographically inconsistent. Existing areas by
which exposures are measured, like Zip codes, average over irrelevant
administratively-defined boundaries. Hence, in order to enable studies of
online social environmental measures like attitudes on social media and their
possible relationship to health outcomes, first there is a need for a method to
define the collective, underlying degree of social media attitudes by region.
To address this, we create the Socio-spatial-Self organizing map, ""SS-SOM""
pipeline to best identify regions by their latent social attitude from Twitter
posts. SS-SOMs use neural embedding for text-classification, and augment
traditional SOMs to generate a controlled number of non-overlapping,
topologically-constrained and topically-similar clusters. We find that not only
are SS-SOMs robust to missing data, the exposure of a cohort of men who are
susceptible to multiple racism and homophobia-linked health outcomes, changes
by up to 42% using SS-SOM measures as compared to using Zip code-based
measures.
"
21825,A Large-Scale Study of Language Models for Chord Prediction,"  We conduct a large-scale study of language models for chord prediction.
Specifically, we compare N-gram models to various flavours of recurrent neural
networks on a comprehensive dataset comprising all publicly available datasets
of annotated chords known to us. This large amount of data allows us to
systematically explore hyper-parameter settings for the recurrent neural
networks---a crucial step in achieving good results with this model class. Our
results show not only a quantitative difference between the models, but also a
qualitative one: in contrast to static N-gram models, certain RNN
configurations adapt to the songs at test time. This finding constitutes a
further step towards the development of chord recognition systems that are more
aware of local musical context than what was previously possible.
"
21826,A Novel Method of Subgroup Identification by Combining Virtual Twins with GUIDE (VG) for Development of Precision Medicines,"  A lack of understanding of human biology creates a hurdle for the development
of precision medicines. To overcome this hurdle we need to better understand
the potential synergy between a given investigational treatment (vs. placebo or
active control) and various demographic or genetic factors, disease history and
severity, etc., with the goal of identifying those patients at increased risk
of exhibiting clinically meaningful treatment benefit. For this reason, we
propose the VG method, which combines the idea of an individual treatment
effect (ITE) from Virtual Twins (Foster, et al., 2011) with the unbiased
variable selection and cutoff value determination algorithm from GUIDE (Loh, et
al., 2015). Simulation results show the VG method has less variable selection
bias than Virtual Twins and higher statistical power than GUIDE Interaction in
the presence of prognostic variables with strong treatment effects. Type I
error and predictive performance of Virtual Twins, GUIDE and VG are compared
through the use of simulation studies. Results obtained after retrospectively
applying VG to data from a clinical trial also are discussed.
"
21827,Critical Slowing Down of Quadrupole and Hexadecapole Orderings in Iron Pnictide Superconductor,"  Ultrasonic measurements have been carried out to investigate the critical
dynamics of structural and superconducting transitions due to degenerate
orbital bands in iron pnictide compounds with the formula
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. The attenuation coefficient
$\alpha_{\mathrm{L}[110]}$ of the longitudinal ultrasonic wave for
$(C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{66})/2$ for $x = 0.036$ reveals the critical slowing down
of the relaxation time around the structural transition at $T_\mathrm{s} = 65$
K, which is caused by ferro-type ordering of the quadrupole $O_{x'^2-y'^2}$
coupled to the strain $\varepsilon_{xy}$. The attenuation coefficient
$\alpha_{66}$ of the transverse ultrasonic wave for $C_{66}$ for $x = 0.071$
also exhibits the critical slowing down around the superconducting transition
at $T_\mathrm{SC} = 23$ K, which is caused by ferro-type ordering of the
hexadecapole $H_z^\alpha \bigl( \boldsymbol{r}_i, \boldsymbol{r}_j \bigr) =
O_{x'y'}\bigl( \boldsymbol{r}_i \bigr) O_{x'^2 - y'^2}\bigl( \boldsymbol{r}_j
\bigr)
+ O_{x'^2 - y'^2}\bigl( \boldsymbol{r}_i \bigr) O_{x'y'}\bigl(
\boldsymbol{r}_j \bigr)$ of the bound two-electron state coupled to the
rotation $\omega_{xy}$. It is proposed that the hexadecapole ordering
associated with the superconductivity brings about spontaneous rotation of the
macroscopic superconducting state with respect to the host tetragonal lattice.
"
21828,On the Interaction between Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand and Public Transportation Systems,"  In this paper we study models and coordination policies for intermodal
Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD), wherein a fleet of self-driving vehicles
provides on-demand mobility jointly with public transit. Specifically, we first
present a network flow model for intermodal AMoD, where we capture the coupling
between AMoD and public transit and the goal is to maximize social welfare.
Second, leveraging such a model, we design a pricing and tolling scheme that
allows to achieve the social optimum under the assumption of a perfect market
with selfish agents. Finally, we present a real-world case study for New York
City. Our results show that the coordination between AMoD fleets and public
transit can yield significant benefits compared to an AMoD system operating in
isolation.
"
21829,"The class of second order quasilinear equations: models, solutions and background of classification","  The paper is concerned with the unsteady solutions to the model of mutually
penetrating continua and quasilinear hyperbolic modification of the Burgers
equation (QHMB). The studies were focused on the peculiar solutions of models
in question. On the base of these models and their solutions, the ideas of
second order quasilinear models classification were developed.

21830,Solving Almost all Systems of Random Quadratic Equations,"  This paper deals with finding an $n$-dimensional solution $x$ to a system of
quadratic equations of the form $y_i=|\langle{a}_i,x\rangle|^2$ for $1\le i \le
m$, which is also known as phase retrieval and is NP-hard in general. We put
forth a novel procedure for minimizing the amplitude-based least-squares
empirical loss, that starts with a weighted maximal correlation initialization
obtainable with a few power or Lanczos iterations, followed by successive
refinements based upon a sequence of iteratively reweighted (generalized)
gradient iterations. The two (both the initialization and gradient flow) stages
distinguish themselves from prior contributions by the inclusion of a fresh
(re)weighting regularization technique. The overall algorithm is conceptually
simple, numerically scalable, and easy-to-implement. For certain random
measurement models, the novel procedure is shown capable of finding the true
solution $x$ in time proportional to reading the data $\{(a_i;y_i)\}_{1\le i
\le m}$. This holds with high probability and without extra assumption on the
signal $x$ to be recovered, provided that the number $m$ of equations is some
constant $c>0$ times the number $n$ of unknowns in the signal vector, namely,
$m>cn$. Empirically, the upshots of this contribution are: i) (almost) $100\%$
perfect signal recovery in the high-dimensional (say e.g., $n\ge 2,000$) regime
given only an information-theoretic limit number of noiseless equations,
namely, $m=2n-1$ in the real-valued Gaussian case; and, ii) (nearly) optimal
statistical accuracy in the presence of additive noise of bounded support.
Finally, substantial numerical tests using both synthetic data and real images
corroborate markedly improved signal recovery performance and computational
efficiency of our novel procedure relative to state-of-the-art approaches.

21831,Predicting the outcomes of fuel drop impact on heated surfaces using SPH simulation,"  The impact of liquid drops on a heated solid surface is of great importance
in many engineering applications. This paper describes the simulation of the
drop-wall interaction using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method.
The SPH method is a Lagrangian mesh-free method that can be used to solve the
fluid equations. A vaporization model based on the SPH formulation was also
developed and implemented. A parametric study was conducted to characterize the
effects of impact velocity and wall temperature on the impact outcome. The
present numerical method was able to predict different outcomes, such as
deposition, splash, breakup, and rebound (i.e., Leidenfrost phenomenon). The
present numerical method was used to construct a regime diagram for describing
the impact of an iso-octane drop on a heated surface at various Weber numbers
and wall temperatures.
"
21832,Learning in the Machine: the Symmetries of the Deep Learning Channel,"  In a physical neural system, learning rules must be local both in space and
time. In order for learning to occur, non-local information must be
communicated to the deep synapses through a communication channel, the deep
learning channel. We identify several possible architectures for this learning
channel (Bidirectional, Conjoined, Twin, Distinct) and six symmetry challenges:
1) symmetry of architectures; 2) symmetry of weights; 3) symmetry of neurons;
4) symmetry of derivatives; 5) symmetry of processing; and 6) symmetry of
learning rules. Random backpropagation (RBP) addresses the second and third
symmetry, and some of its variations, such as skipped RBP (SRBP) address the
first and the fourth symmetry. Here we address the last two desirable
symmetries showing through simulations that they can be achieved and that the
learning channel is particularly robust to symmetry variations. Specifically,
random backpropagation and its variations can be performed with the same
non-linear neurons used in the main input-output forward channel, and the
connections in the learning channel can be adapted using the same algorithm
used in the forward channel, removing the need for any specialized hardware in
the learning channel. Finally, we provide mathematical results in simple cases
showing that the learning equations in the forward and backward channels
converge to fixed points, for almost any initial conditions. In symmetric
architectures, if the weights in both channels are small at initialization,
adaptation in both channels leads to weights that are essentially symmetric
during and after learning. Biological connections are discussed.
"
21833,Coset spaces of metrizable groups,"  We characterize coset spaces of topological groups which are coset spaces of
(separable) metrizable groups and complete metrizable (Polish) groups. Besides,
it is shown that for a $G$-space $X$ with a $d$-open action there is a
topological group $H$ of weight and cardinality less than or equal to the
weight of $X$ such that $H$ admits a $d$-open action on $X$. This is further
applied to show that if $X$ is a separable metrizable coset space then $X$ has
a Polish extension which is a coset space of a Polish group.
"
21834,A Minimum Reconfiguration Probability Routing Algorithm for RWA in All-Optical Networks,"  In this paper, we present a detailed study of Minimum Reconfiguration
Probability Routing (MRPR) algorithm, and its performance evaluation in
comparison with Adaptive unconstrained routing (AUR) and Least Loaded routing
(LLR) algorithms. We have minimized the effects of failures on link and router
failure in the network under changing load conditions, we assess the
probability of service and number of light path failures due to link or route
failure on Wavelength Interchange(WI) network. The computation complexity is
reduced by using Kalman Filter(KF) techniques. The minimum reconfiguration
probability routing (MRPR) algorithm selects most reliable routes and assign
wavelengths to connections in a manner that utilizes the light path(LP)
established efficiently considering all possible requests.
"
21835,Emergence of correlated proton tunneling in water ice,"  Several experimental and theoretical studies report instances of concerted or
correlated multiple proton tunneling in solid phases of water. Here, we
construct a pseudo-spin model for the quantum motion of protons in a hexameric
H$_2$O ring and extend it to open system dynamics that takes environmental
effects into account in the form of O$-$H stretch vibrations. We approach the
problem of correlations in tunneling using quantum information theory in a
departure from previous studies. Our formalism enables us to quantify the
coherent proton mobility around the hexagonal ring by one of the principal
measures of coherence, the $l_1$ norm of coherence. The nature of the pairwise
pseudo-spin correlations underlying the overall mobility is further
investigated within this formalism. We show that the classical correlations of
the individual quantum tunneling events in long-time limit is sufficient to
capture the behaviour of coherent proton mobility observed in low-temperature
experiments. We conclude that long-range intra-ring interactions do not appear
to be a necessary condition for correlated proton tunneling in water ice.
"
21836,Constrained path-finding and structure from acyclicity,"  This note presents several results in graph theory inspired by the author's
work in the proof theory of linear logic; these results are purely
combinatorial and do not involve logic.
We show that trails avoiding forbidden transitions and rainbow paths for
complete multipartite color classes can be found in linear time, whereas
finding rainbow paths is NP-complete for any other restriction on color
classes. For the tractable cases, we also state new structural properties
equivalent to Kotzig's theorem on bridges in unique perfect matchings.
We also exhibit a connection between blossoms and bridge deletion orders in
unique perfect matchings.
"
21837,Constraints on the optical polarization source in the luminous non-blazar quasar 3C 323.1 (PG 1545+210) from the photometric and polarimetric variability,"  We examine the optical photometric and polarimetric variability of the
luminous type 1 non-blazar quasar 3C 323.1 (PG 1545+210). Two optical
spectro-polarimetric measurements taken during the periods 1996$-$98 and 2003
combined with a $V$-band imaging polarimetric measurement taken in 2002 reveal
that (1) as noted in the literature, the polarization of 3C 323.1 is confined
only to the continuum emission, that is, the emission from the broad line
region is unpolarized; (2) the polarized flux spectra show evidence of a
time-variable broad absorption feature in the wavelength range of the Balmer
continuum and other recombination lines; (3) weak variability in the
polarization position angle ($PA$) of $\sim$ 4 deg over a time-scale of 4$-$6
years is observed; and (4) the V-band total flux and the polarized flux show
highly correlated variability over a time-scale of one year. Taking the
above-mentioned photometric and polarimetric variability properties and the
results from previous studies into consideration, we propose a geometrical
model for the polarization source in 3C 323.1, in which an equatorial absorbing
region and an axi-asymmetric equatorial electron-scattering region are assumed
to be located between the accretion disc and the broad line region. The
scattering/absorbing regions can perhaps be attributed to the accretion disc
wind or flared disc surface, but further polarimetric monitoring observations
for 3C~323.1 and other quasars with continuum-confined polarization are needed
to probe the true physical origins of these regions.
"
21838,Cliff-Weiss Inequalities and the Zassenhaus Conjecture,"  Let $N$ be a nilpotent normal subgroup of the finite group $G$. Assume that
$u$ is a unit of finite order in the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ of $G$
which maps to the identity under the linear extension of the natural
homomorphism $G \rightarrow G/N$. We show how a result of Cliff and Weiss can
be used to derive linear inequalities on the partial augmentations of $u$ and
apply this to the study of the Zassenhaus Conjecture. This conjecture states
that any unit of finite order in $\mathbb{Z} G$ is conjugate in the rational
group algebra of $G$ to an element in $\pm G$.
"
21839,Flow Navigation by Smart Microswimmers via Reinforcement Learning,"  Smart active particles can acquire some limited knowledge of the fluid
environment from simple mechanical cues and exert a control on their preferred
steering direction. Their goal is to learn the best way to navigate by
exploiting the underlying flow whenever possible. As an example, we focus our
attention on smart gravitactic swimmers. These are active particles whose task
is to reach the highest altitude within some time horizon, given the
constraints enforced by fluid mechanics. By means of numerical experiments, we
show that swimmers indeed learn nearly optimal strategies just by experience. A
reinforcement learning algorithm allows particles to learn effective strategies
even in difficult situations when, in the absence of control, they would end up
being trapped by flow structures. These strategies are highly nontrivial and
cannot be easily guessed in advance. This Letter illustrates the potential of
reinforcement learning algorithms to model adaptive behavior in complex flows
and paves the way towards the engineering of smart microswimmers that solve
difficult navigation problems.
"
21840,Synthesizing a Clock Signal with Reactions---Part II: Frequency Alteration Based on Gears,"  On a chassis of gear model, we have offered a quantitative description for
our method to synthesize a chemical clock signal with various duty cycles in
Part I. As Part II of the study, this paper devotes itself in proposing a
design methodology to handle frequency alteration issues for the chemical
clock, including both frequency division and frequency multiplication. Several
interesting examples are provided for a better explanation of our contribution.
All the simulation results verify and validate the correctness and efficiency
of our proposal.
"
21841,A characterization of affinely regular polygons,"  In 1970, Coxeter gave a short and elegant geometric proof showing that if
$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ are vertices of an $n$-gon $P$ in cyclic order, then
$P$ is affinely regular if, and only if there is some $\lambda \geq 0$ such
that $p_{j+2}-p_{j-1} = \lambda (p_{j+1}-p_j)$ for $j=1,2,\ldots, n$. The aim
of this paper is to examine the properties of polygons whose vertices
$p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n \in \mathbb{C}$ satisfy the property that
$p_{j+m_1}-p_{j+m_2} = w (p_{j+k}-p_j)$ for some $w \in \mathbb{C}$ and
$m_1,m_2,k \in \mathbb{Z}$. In particular, we show that in `most' cases this
implies that the polygon is affinely regular, but in some special cases there
are polygons which satisfy this property but are not affinely regular. The
proofs are based on the use of linear algebraic and number theoretic tools. In
addition, we apply our method to characterize polytopes with certain symmetry
groups.
"
21842,On detection and annihilation of spherical virus embedded in a fluid matrix at low and moderate Reynolds number,"  Effect of high and low Reynolds number is studied on low frequency
vibrational modes of a spherical virus embedded in the aqueous medium. We have
used an analytical approach based on fluid dynamic and classical Lamb theory to
calculate the vibrational modes of a virus with material parameters of lysozyme
crystal in water. The obvious size effect on the vibrational modes is observed.
The estimated damping time which is of the order of picosecond varies with
Reynolds number and shows a high value for a critical Reynolds number. The
stationary eigenfrequency regions are observed for every quantum number l and n
suggesting the most probable Re ranges for acoustic treatment of viruses in
order to detect or annihilate the virus using corresponding viruswater
configuration.
"
21843,Robust two-level system control by a detuned and chirped laser pulse,"  We propose and demonstrate a robust control scheme by ultrafast nonadiabatic
chirped laser pulse, designed for targeting coherent superpositions of
two-level systems. Robustness against power fluctuation is proved by our
numerical study and a proof-of-principle experiment performed with femtosecond
laser interaction on cold atoms. They exhibit for the final driven dynamics a
cusp on the Bloch sphere, corresponding to a zero curvature of fidelity. This
solution is particularly simple and thus applicable to a wide range of
potential applications.
"
21844,Analyzing Diffusion and Flow-driven Instability using Semidefinite Programming,"  Diffusion and flow-driven instability, or transport-driven instability, is
one of the central mechanisms to generate inhomogeneous gradient of
concentrations in spatially distributed chemical systems. However, verifying
the transport-driven instability of reaction-diffusion-advection systems
requires checking the Jacobian eigenvalues of infinitely many Fourier modes,
which is computationally intractable. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes mathematical optimization algorithms that determine the
stability/instability of reaction-diffusion-advection systems by finite steps
of algebraic calculations. Specifically, the stability/instability analysis of
Fourier modes is formulated as a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program,
which is a class of convex optimization whose solvers are widely available as
software packages. The optimization program is further extended for facile
computation of the destabilizing spatial modes. This extension allows for
predicting and designing the shape of concentration gradient without simulating
the governing equations. The streamlined analysis process of self-organized
pattern formation is demonstrated with a simple illustrative reaction model
with diffusion and advection.
"
21845,Petrographic and geochemical evidence for multiphase formation of carbonates in the Martian orthopyroxenite Allan Hills 84001,"  Martian meteorites can provide valuable information about past environmental
conditions on Mars. Allan Hills 84001 formed more than 4 Gyr ago, and owing to
its age and long exposure to the Martian environment, this meteorite has
features that may record early processes. These features include a highly
fractured texture, gases trapped during one or more impact events or during
formation of the rock, and spherical Fe-Mg-Ca carbonates. Here we have
concentrated on providing new insights into the context of these carbonates
using a range of techniques to explore whether they record multiple
precipitation and shock events. The petrographic features and compositional
properties of these carbonates indicate that at least two pulses of Mg- and
Fe-rich solutions saturated the rock. Those two generations of carbonates can
be distinguished by a very sharp change in compositions, from being rich in Mg
and poor in Fe and Mn, to being poor in Mg and rich in Fe and Mn. Between these
two generations of carbonate is evidence for fracturing and local corrosion.
"
21846,Distributed Random-Fixed Projected Algorithm for Constrained Optimization Over Digraphs,"  This paper is concerned with a constrained optimization problem over a
directed graph (digraph) of nodes, in which the cost function is a sum of local
objectives, and each node only knows its local objective and constraints. To
collaboratively solve the optimization, most of the existing works require the
interaction graph to be balanced or ""doubly-stochastic"", which is quite
restrictive and not necessary as shown in this paper. We focus on an epigraph
form of the original optimization to resolve the ""unbalanced"" problem, and
design a novel two-step recursive algorithm with a simple structure. Under
strongly connected digraphs, we prove that each node asymptotically converges
to some common optimal solution. Finally, simulations are performed to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
"
21847,Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images,"  Each year, the treatment decisions for more than 230,000 breast cancer
patients in the U.S. hinge on whether the cancer has metastasized away from the
breast. Metastasis detection is currently performed by pathologists reviewing
large expanses of biological tissues. This process is labor intensive and
error-prone. We present a framework to automatically detect and localize tumors
as small as 100 x 100 pixels in gigapixel microscopy images sized 100,000 x
100,000 pixels. Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture and obtains state-of-the-art results on the Camelyon16 dataset in
the challenging lesion-level tumor detection task. At 8 false positives per
image, we detect 92.4% of the tumors, relative to 82.7% by the previous best
automated approach. For comparison, a human pathologist attempting exhaustive
search achieved 73.2% sensitivity. We achieve image-level AUC scores above 97%
on both the Camelyon16 test set and an independent set of 110 slides. In
addition, we discover that two slides in the Camelyon16 training set were
erroneously labeled normal. Our approach could considerably reduce false
negative rates in metastasis detection.
"
21848,Edge insulating topological phases in a two-dimensional long-range superconductor,"  We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a two dimensional square
lattice loaded by spinless fermions, with nearest neighbor hopping and
algebraically decaying pairing. We find that for sufficiently long-range
pairing, new phases, not continuously connected with any short-range phase,
occur, signaled by the violation of the area law for the Von Neumann entropy,
by semi-integer Chern numbers, and by edge modes with nonzero mass. The latter
feature results in the absence of single-fermion edge conductivity, present
instead in the short- range limit. The definition of a topology in the bulk and
the presence of a bulk-boundary correspondence is still suggested for the
long-range phases. Recent experimental proposals and advances open the
stimulating possibility to probe the described long-range effects in
next-future realistic set-ups.
"
21849,Using mobile service for supply chain management : a survey and challenges,"  Efficient supply chain management calls for robust analytical and optimal
models to automate its process. Therefore, information technology is an
essential ingredient that integrates these tools in supply chain. With the
emergence of wireless, the high technologies and the reliability of mobile
devices, mobile web services draw a promising horizon facing economic
challenges. They offer new personalized services to each actor in the supply
chain on their mobile devices at anytime and anywhere. This paper presents a
literature review of mobile web service implemented on the industry context
based on the supply chain management approach. First, a large definition of
mobile web service and some proposal architecture are exposed. Then the paper
discuss some generic related work on mobile web service focusing on supply
chain management. Finally some challenges on m-service oriented supply chain
management are proposed.
"
21850,Statistical distribution of roots of a polynomial modulo primes,"  Let $f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_0$ be an irreducible polynomial with
integer coefficients. For a prime $p$ for which $f(x)$ is fully splitting
modulo $ p$, we consider $n$ roots $r_i$ of $f(x)\equiv 0\bmod p$ with $0 \le
r_1\le\dots\le r_n<p$ and propose several conjectures on the distribution of an
integer $\lceil \sum_{i\in S} r_i/p\rceil$ for a subset $S$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$
when $p\to\infty$.
"
21851,The index of coincidence for the binomial distribution is log-convex,"  We consider the binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $x$, and show
that the sum of the squared probabilities is a log-convex function of $x$. This
completes the proof of a conjecture formulated in 2014. Applications to
Rényi and Tsallis entropies are given.
"
21852,"Elements of Consciousness and Cognition. Biology, Mathematic, Physics and Panpsychism: an Information Topology Perspective","  This review presents recent and older results on elementary quantitative and
qualitative aspects of consciousness and cognition and tackles the question
""What is consciousness?"" conjointly from biological, neuroscience-cognitive,
physical and mathematical points of view. It proposes to unify various results
and theories by means of information topology.
The first chapter presents the postulates and results on elementary
perception at various organizational scales of the nervous system and proposes
the hypothesis of an electrodynamic intrinsic nature of consciousness which is
sustained by an analogical code. It underlines the diversity of the learning
mechanisms that sustain the dynamics of perception and consciousness, including
adaptive and homeostatic processes on multiple scales.
The second chapter investigates the logical aspects of cognition and
consciousness and proposes an axiomatization based on measure and probability
theory. Topos and constructive logic are presented as providing an intrinsic
probabilistic logic, with the long-term aim of avoiding the paradoxical
decomposition induced by the Axiom of Choice. We sketch an elementary procedure
allowing an expression of the information of a mathematical formula a la Godel.
We then present the formalism of information topology and propose that it
provides a preliminary basis for synthesizing the main models of cognition and
consciousness within a formal Gestalt theory. Information topology establishes
a characterization of information theory functions, allowing for a precise
expression of information structures and patterns. It provides a quantification
of the structure of statistical interactions and their expression in terms of
statistical physics and machine learning. Notably, those topological methods
allow conciliation of some of the main theories of consciousness.
"
21853,The Error Probability of Random Fourier Features is Dimensionality Independent,"  We show that the error probability of reconstructing kernel matrices from
Random Fourier Features for the Gaussian kernel function is at most
$\mathcal{O}(R^{2/3} \exp(-D))$, where $D$ is the number of random features and
$R$ is the diameter of the data domain. We also provide an
information-theoretic method-independent lower bound of $\Omega((1-\exp(-R^2))
\exp(-D))$. Compared to prior work, we are the first to show that the error
probability for random Fourier features is independent of the dimensionality of
data points. As applications of our theory, we obtain dimension-independent
bounds for kernel ridge regression and support vector machines.
"
21854,Ultrafast carbon monoxide photolysis and heme spin-crossover in myoglobin via nonadiabatic quantum dynamics,"  Light absorption of myoglobin triggers diatomic ligand photolysis and spin
crossover transition of iron(II) that initiate protein conformational change.
The photolysis and spin crossover reactions happen concurrently on a
femtosecond timescale. The microscopic origin of these reactions remains
controversial. Here, we apply quantum wavepacket dynamics to elucidate the
ultrafast photochemical mechanism for a heme--carbon monoxide (heme--CO)
complex. We observe coherent oscillations of the Fe-CO bond distance with a
period of 42 fs and an amplitude of $\sim$1 \AA{}. These nuclear motions induce
pronounced geometric reorganization, which makes the CO dissociation
irreversible. The reaction is initially dominated by symmetry breaking
vibrations inducing an electron transfer from porphyrin to iron. Subsequently,
the wavepacket relaxes to the triplet manifold in $\sim$75 fs and to the
quintet manifold in $\sim$430 fs. Our results highlight the central role of
nuclear vibrations at the origin of the ultrafast photodynamics of
organometallic complexes.
"
21855,Single-cluster PHD filter methods for joint multi-object filtering and parameter estimation,"  Many multi-object estimation problems require additional estimation of model
or sensor parameters that are either common to all objects or related to
unknown characterisation of one or more sensors. Important examples of these
include registration of multiple sensors, estimating clutter profiles, and
robot localisation. Often these parameters are estimated separately to the
multi-object estimation process, which can lead to systematic errors or
overconfidence in the estimates. These parameters can be estimated jointly with
the multi-object process based only on the sensor data using a single-cluster
point process model. This paper presents novel results for joint parameter
estimation and multi-object filtering based on a single-cluster second-order
Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) and Cardinalised PHD (CPHD) filter.
Experiments provide a comparison between the discussed approaches using
different likelihood functions.
"
21856,Source Code Properties of Defective Infrastructure as Code Scripts,"  Context: In continuous deployment, software and services are rapidly deployed
to end-users using an automated deployment pipeline. Defects in infrastructure
as code (IaC) scripts can hinder the reliability of the automated deployment
pipeline. We hypothesize that certain properties of IaC source code such as
lines of code and hard-coded strings used as configuration values, show
correlation with defective IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper
is to help practitioners in increasing the quality of infrastructure as code
(IaC) scripts through an empirical study that identifies source code properties
of defective IaC scripts. Methodology: We apply qualitative analysis on
defect-related commits mined from open source software repositories to identify
source code properties that correlate with defective IaC scripts. Next, we
survey practitioners to assess the practitioner's agreement level with the
identified properties. We also construct defect prediction models using the
identified properties for 2,439 scripts collected from four datasets. Results:
We identify 10 source code properties that correlate with defective IaC
scripts. Of the identified 10 properties we observe lines of code and
hard-coded string to show the strongest correlation with defective IaC scripts.
Hard-coded string is the property of specifying configuration value as
hard-coded string. According to our survey analysis, majority of the
practitioners show agreement for two properties: include, the property of
executing external modules or scripts, and hard-coded string. Using the
identified properties, our constructed defect prediction models show a
precision of 0.70~0.78, and a recall of 0.54~0.67.
"
21857,First results from the IllustrisTNG simulations: matter and galaxy clustering,"  Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient
volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant
scales. Here we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear
correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies and
haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic
effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the
total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ~ 10 h/Mpc by 20%. The non-linear
two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over
a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high
redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated
galaxies agrees well with SDSS at its mean redshift z ~ 0.1, both as a function
of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild
excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range 10^9-10^10
Msun/h^2. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable
theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We
find that the clustering length of the galaxy auto-correlation function depends
strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope gamma is nearly
invariant with stellar mass, but declines from gamma ~ 1.8 at redshift z=0 to
gamma ~ 1.6 at redshift z ~ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect
significant scale-dependencies in the bias of different observational tracers
of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic
acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts
of the acoustic peaks of around ~5%.
"
21858,Efficient Computation of the 8-point DCT via Summation by Parts,"  This paper introduces a new fast algorithm for the 8-point discrete cosine
transform (DCT) based on the summation-by-parts formula. The proposed method
converts the DCT matrix into an alternative transformation matrix that can be
decomposed into sparse matrices of low multiplicative complexity. The method is
capable of scaled and exact DCT computation and its associated fast algorithm
achieves the theoretical minimal multiplicative complexity for the 8-point DCT.
Depending on the nature of the input signal simplifications can be introduced
and the overall complexity of the proposed algorithm can be further reduced.
Several types of input signal are analyzed: arbitrary, null mean, accumulated,
and null mean/accumulated signal. The proposed tool has potential application
in harmonic detection, image enhancement, and feature extraction, where input
signal DC level is discarded and/or the signal is required to be integrated.
"
21859,Further insights into the damping-induced self-recovery phenomenon,"  In a series of papers, D. E. Chang, et al., proved and experimentally
demonstrated a phenomenon they termed ""damping-induced self-recovery"". However,
these papers left a few questions concerning the observed phenomenon unanswered
- in particular, the effect of the intervening lubricant-fluid and its
viscosity on the recovery, the abrupt change in behaviour with the introduction
of damping, a description of the energy dynamics, and the curious occurrence of
overshoots and oscillations and its dependence on the control law. In this
paper we attempt to answer these questions through theory. In particular, we
derive an expression for the infinite-dimensional fluid-stool-wheel system,
that approximates its dynamics to that of the better understood
finite-dimensional case.
"
21860,Duality of channels and codes,"  For any given channel $W$ with classical inputs and possibly quantum outputs,
a dual classical-input channel $W^\perp$ can be defined by embedding the
original into a channel $\mathcal N$ with quantum inputs and outputs. Here we
give new uncertainty relations for a general class of entropies that lead to
very close relationships between the original channel and its dual. Moreover,
we show that channel duality can be combined with duality of linear codes,
whereupon the uncertainty relations imply that the performance of a given code
over a given channel is entirely characterized by the performance of the dual
code on the dual channel. This has several applications. In the context of
polar codes, it implies that the rates of polarization to ideal and useless
channels must be identical. Duality also relates the tasks of channel coding
and privacy amplification, implying that the finite blocklength performance of
extractors and codes is precisely linked, and that optimal rate extractors can
be transformed into capacity-achieving codes, and vice versa. Finally, duality
also extends to the EXIT function of any channel and code. Here it implies that
for any channel family, if the EXIT function for a fixed code has a sharp
transition, then it must be such that the rate of the code equals the capacity
at the transition. This may give a different route to proving a code family
achieves capacity by establishing sharp EXIT function transitions.
"
21861,BIOS ORAM: Improved Privacy-Preserving Data Access for Parameterized Outsourced Storage,"  Algorithms for oblivious random access machine (ORAM) simulation allow a
client, Alice, to obfuscate a pattern of data accesses with a server, Bob, who
is maintaining Alice's outsourced data while trying to learn information about
her data. We present a novel ORAM scheme that improves the asymptotic I/O
overhead of previous schemes for a wide range of size parameters for
client-side private memory and message blocks, from logarithmic to polynomial.
Our method achieves statistical security for hiding Alice's access pattern and,
with high probability, achieves an I/O overhead that ranges from $O(1)$ to
$O(\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$, depending on these size parameters, where $n$ is
the size of Alice's outsourced memory. Our scheme, which we call BIOS ORAM,
combines multiple uses of B-trees with a reduction of ORAM simulation to
isogrammic access sequences.
"
21862,SMILES2Vec: An Interpretable General-Purpose Deep Neural Network for Predicting Chemical Properties,"  Chemical databases store information in text representations, and the SMILES
format is a universal standard used in many cheminformatics software. Encoded
in each SMILES string is structural information that can be used to predict
complex chemical properties. In this work, we develop SMILES2vec, a deep RNN
that automatically learns features from SMILES to predict chemical properties,
without the need for additional explicit feature engineering. Using Bayesian
optimization methods to tune the network architecture, we show that an
optimized SMILES2vec model can serve as a general-purpose neural network for
predicting distinct chemical properties including toxicity, activity,
solubility and solvation energy, while also outperforming contemporary MLP
neural networks that uses engineered features. Furthermore, we demonstrate
proof-of-concept of interpretability by developing an explanation mask that
localizes on the most important characters used in making a prediction. When
tested on the solubility dataset, it identified specific parts of a chemical
that is consistent with established first-principles knowledge with an accuracy
of 88%. Our work demonstrates that neural networks can learn technically
accurate chemical concept and provide state-of-the-art accuracy, making
interpretable deep neural networks a useful tool of relevance to the chemical
industry.

21863,Gauss factorials of polynomials over finite fields,"  In this paper we initiate a study on Gauss factorials of polynomials over
finite fields, which are the analogues of Gauss factorials of positive
integers.
"
21864,"Topological Phases in Graphene Nanoribbons: Junction States, Spin Centers and Quantum Spin Chains","  Knowledge of the topology of the electronic ground state of materials has led
to deep insights to novel phenomena such as the integer quantum Hall effect and
fermion-number fractionalization, as well as other properties of matter.
Joining two insulators of different topological classes produces fascinating
boundary states in the band gap. Another exciting recent development is the
bottom-up synthesis (from molecular precursors) of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
with atomic precision control of their edge and width. Here we connect these
two fields, and show for the first time that semiconducting GNRs of different
width, edge, and end termination belong to different topological classes. The
topology of GNRs is protected by spatial symmetries and dictated by the
terminating unit cell. We have derived explicit formula for their topological
invariants, and show that localized junction states developed between two GNRs
of distinct topology may be tuned by lateral junction geometry. The topology of
a GNR can be further modified by dopants, such as a periodic array of boron
atoms. In a superlattice consisted of segments of doped and pristine GNRs, the
junction states are stable spin centers, forming a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic
spin 1/2 chain with tunable exchange interaction. The discoveries here are not
only of scientific interest for studies of quasi one-dimensional systems, but
also open a new path for design principles of future GNR-based devices through
their topological characters.
"
21865,Antiferromagnetic magnons from fractionalized excitations,"  We develop an approach to describe antiferromagnetic magnons on a bipartite
lattice supporting the Néel state using fractionalized degrees of freedom
typically inherent to quantum spin liquids. In particular we consider a
long-range magnetically ordered state of interacting two-dimensional quantum
spin$-1/2$ models using the Chern-Simons (CS) fermion representation of
interacting spins. The interaction leads to Cooper instability and pairing of
CS fermions, and to CS superconductivity which spontaneously violates the
continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry generating a linearly-dispersing gapless
Nambu-Goldstone mode due to phase fluctuations. We evaluate this mode and show
that it is in high-precision agreement with magnons of the corresponding
Néel antiferromagnet irrespective to the lattice symmetry. Using the
fermion formulation of a system with competing interactions, we show that the
frustration gives raise to nontrivial long-range four, six, and higher-leg
interaction vertices mediated by the CS gauge field, which are responsible for
restoring of the continuous symmetry at sufficiently strong frustration. We
identify these new interaction vertices and discuss their implications to
unconventional phase transitions. We also apply the proposed theory to a model
of anyons that can be tuned continuously from fermions to bosons.
"
21866,"Secular chaotic dynamics in hierarchical quadruple systems, with applications to hot Jupiters in stellar binaries and triples","  Hierarchical quadruple systems arise naturally in stellar binaries and
triples that harbour planets. Examples are hot Jupiters (HJs) in stellar triple
systems, and planetary companions to HJs in stellar binaries. The secular
dynamical evolution of these systems is generally complex, with secular chaotic
motion possible in certain parameter regimes. The latter can lead to extremely
high eccentricities and, therefore, strong interactions such as efficient tidal
evolution. These interactions are believed to play an important role in the
formation of HJs through high-eccentricity migration. Nevertheless, a deeper
understanding of the secular dynamics of these systems is still lacking. Here
we study in detail the secular dynamics of a special case of hierarchical
quadruple systems in either the `2+2' or `3+1' configurations. We show how the
equations of motion can be cast in a form representing a perturbed hierarchical
three-body system, in which the outer orbital angular momentum vector is
precessing steadily around a fixed axis. In this case, we show that
eccentricity excitation can be significantly enhanced when the precession
period is comparable to the Lidov-Kozai oscillation time-scale of the inner
orbit. This arises from an induced large mutual inclination between the inner
and outer orbits driven by the precession of the outer orbit, even if the
initial mutual inclination is small. We present a simplified semi-analytic
model that describes the latter phenomenon.
"
21867,Cobordisms of graphs. A sliceness criterion for stably odd knots and related results on cobordisms,"  In [D.A. Fedoseev, V.O. Manturov, A sliceness criterion for odd free
knots,arXiv:1707.04923], the authors proved a sliceness criterion for odd free
knots: free knots with odd chords. In the present paper we give a similar
criterion for stably odd free knots. Some additional results on knot sliceness
and cobordism are given.
"
21868,Efficient Information Flow Maximization in Probabilistic Graphs,"  Reliable propagation of information through large networks, e.g.,
communication networks, social networks or sensor networks is very important in
many applications concerning marketing, social networks, and wireless sensor
networks. However, social ties of friendship may be obsolete, and communication
links may fail, inducing the notion of uncertainty in such networks. In this
paper, we address the problem of optimizing information propagation in
uncertain networks given a constrained budget of edges. We show that this
problem requires to solve two NP-hard subproblems: the computation of expected
information flow, and the optimal choice of edges. To compute the expected
information flow to a source vertex, we propose the F-tree as a specialized
data structure, that identifies independent components of the graph for which
the information flow can either be computed analytically and efficiently, or
for which traditional Monte-Carlo sampling can be applied independently of the
remaining network. For the problem of finding the optimal edges, we propose a
series of heuristics that exploit properties of this data structure. Our
evaluation shows that these heuristics lead to high quality solutions, thus
yielding high information flow, while maintaining low running time.
"
21869,Analysis Of Congestion Control In Data Channels With Frequent Frame Loss,"  Development of optimal control procedures for congested networks is a key
factor in maintaining efficient network utilization. The absence of congestion
control mechanism or its failure can lead to the lack of availability for
certain network segments, and in severe cases -- for the entire network. The
paper presents an analytical model describing the operation of the TCP Reno
congestion control algorithm in terms of differential calculus and queuing
systems. The purpose of this research is to explore the possibilities and ways
of increasing the virtual channel capacity utilization efficiency in a lossy
environment.
"
21870,Epidemic spreading with awareness and different time scales in multiplex networks,"  One of the major issues in the theoretical modelling of epidemic spreading is
the development of methods to control the transmission of an infectious agent.
Human behaviour plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be
used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals
aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure
to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of
diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the
information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumour model.
Flexibility on the time scale between information and disease spreading is also
included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of
information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show
that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a
decrease of the prevalence, as the relative time scale between disease and
awareness spreadings plays a crucial role in the systems' dynamics. Our results
provide a new view on how information influence disease spreading and can be
used for the development of more efficient methods for disease control.
"
21871,Estimation Efficiency Under Privacy Constraints,"  We investigate the problem of estimating a random variable $Y\in \mathcal{Y}$
under a privacy constraint dictated by another random variable $X\in
\mathcal{X}$, where estimation efficiency and privacy are assessed in terms of
two different loss functions. In the discrete case, we use the Hamming loss
function and express the corresponding utility-privacy tradeoff in terms of the
privacy-constrained guessing probability $h(P_{XY}, \epsilon)$, the maximum
probability $\mathsf{P}_\mathsf{c}(Y|Z)$ of correctly guessing $Y$ given an
auxiliary random variable $Z\in \mathcal{Z}$, where the maximization is taken
over all $P_{Z|Y}$ ensuring that $\mathsf{P}_\mathsf{c}(X|Z)\leq \epsilon$ for
a given privacy threshold $\epsilon \geq 0$. We prove that $h(P_{XY}, \cdot)$
is concave and piecewise linear, which allows us to derive its expression in
closed form for any $\epsilon$ when $X$ and $Y$ are binary. In the non-binary
case, we derive $h(P_{XY}, \epsilon)$ in the high utility regime (i.e., for
sufficiently large values of $\epsilon$) under the assumption that $Z$ takes
values in $\mathcal{Y}$. We also analyze the privacy-constrained guessing
probability for two binary vector scenarios. When $X$ and $Y$ are continuous
random variables, we use the squared-error loss function and express the
corresponding utility-privacy tradeoff in terms of $\mathsf{sENSR}(P_{XY},
\epsilon)$, which is the smallest normalized minimum mean squared-error (mmse)
incurred in estimating $Y$ from its Gaussian perturbation $Z$, such that the
mmse of $f(X)$ given $Z$ is within $\epsilon$ of the variance of $f(X)$ for any
non-constant real-valued function $f$. We derive tight upper and lower bounds
for $\mathsf{sENSR}$ when $Y$ is Gaussian. We also obtain a tight lower bound
for $\mathsf{sENSR}(P_{XY}, \epsilon)$ for general absolutely continuous random
variables when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small.
"
21872,The DTM-signature for a geometric comparison of metric-measure spaces from samples,"  In this paper, we introduce the notion of DTM-signature, a measure on R +
that can be associated to any metric-measure space. This signature is based on
the distance to a measure (DTM) introduced by Chazal, Cohen-Steiner and
Mérigot. It leads to a pseudo-metric between metric-measure spaces,
upper-bounded by the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Under some geometric
assumptions, we derive lower bounds for this pseudo-metric. Given two
N-samples, we also build an asymptotic statistical test based on the
DTM-signature, to reject the hypothesis of equality of the two underlying
metric-measure spaces, up to a measure-preserving isometry. We give strong
theoretical justifications for this test and propose an algorithm for its
implementation.
"
21873,The Schwarz Lemma at the Boundary of the Symmetrized Bidisc,"  The symmetrized bidisc ${\textbf{G}}_{2}$ is defined by
$${\textbf{G}}_{2}:=\{(z_1+z_2,z_1z_2)\in\mathbb{C}^2: |z_1|<1,|z_2|<1,\;
z_1,z_2\in\mathbb{C}\}.$$ It is a bounded inhomogeneous pseudoconvex domain
without $\mathcal{C}^1$ boundary, and especially the symmetrized bidisc hasn't
any strongly pseudoconvex boundary point and the boundary behavior of both
Carathéodory and Kobayashi metrics over the symmetrized bidisc is hard to
describe precisely. In this paper, we study the boundary Schwarz lemma for
holomorphic self-mappings of the symmetrized bidisc ${\textbf{G}}_2$, and our
boundary Schwarz lemma in the paper differs greatly from the earlier related
results.
"
21874,"Group Recommendations: Axioms, Impossibilities, and Random Walks","  We introduce an axiomatic approach to group recommendations, in line of
previous work on the axiomatic treatment of trust-based recommendation systems,
ranking systems, and other foundational work on the axiomatic approach to
internet mechanisms in social choice settings. In group recommendations we wish
to recommend to a group of agents, consisting of both opinionated and undecided
members, a joint choice that would be acceptable to them. Such a system has
many applications, such as choosing a movie or a restaurant to go to with a
group of friends, recommending games for online game players, & other communal
activities.
Our method utilizes a given social graph to extract information on the
undecided, relying on the agents influencing them. We first show that a set of
fairly natural desired requirements (a.k.a axioms) leads to an impossibility,
rendering mutual satisfaction of them unreachable. However, we also show a
modified set of axioms that fully axiomatize a group variant of the random-walk
recommendation system, expanding a previous result from the individual
recommendation case.
"
21875,The conjugate gradient algorithm on well-conditioned Wishart matrices is almost deteriministic,"  We prove that the number of iterations required to solve a random positive
definite linear system with the conjugate gradient algorithm is almost
deterministic for large matrices. We treat the case of Wishart matrices.
Precisely, we prove that for most choices of error tolerance, as the matrix
increases in size, the probability that the iteration count deviates from an
explicit deterministic value tends to zero. In addition, for a fixed iteration,
we show that the norm of the error vector and the norm of the residual converge
exponentially fast in probability, converge in mean, converge almost surely
and, after centering and rescaling, converge in distribution.
"
21876,Feature Extraction for Machine Learning Based Crackle Detection in Lung Sounds from a Health Survey,"  In recent years, many innovative solutions for recording and viewing sounds
from a stethoscope have become available. However, to fully utilize such
devices, there is a need for an automated approach for detecting abnormal lung
sounds, which is better than the existing methods that typically have been
developed and evaluated using a small and non-diverse dataset.
We propose a machine learning based approach for detecting crackles in lung
sounds recorded using a stethoscope in a large health survey. Our method is
trained and evaluated using 209 files with crackles classified by expert
listeners. Our analysis pipeline is based on features extracted from small
windows in audio files. We evaluated several feature extraction methods and
classifiers. We evaluated the pipeline using a training set of 175 crackle
windows and 208 normal windows. We did 100 cycles of cross validation where we
shuffled training sets between cycles. For all the division between training
and evaluation was 70%-30%.
We found and evaluated a 5-dimenstional vector with four features from the
time domain and one from the spectrum domain. We evaluated several classifiers
and found SVM with a Radial Basis Function Kernel to perform best. Our approach
had a precision of 86% and recall of 84% for classifying a crackle in a window,
which is more accurate than found in studies of health personnel. The
low-dimensional feature vector makes the SVM very fast. The model can be
trained on a regular computer in 1.44 seconds, and 319 crackles can be
classified in 1.08 seconds.
Our approach detects and visualizes individual crackles in recorded audio
files. It is accurate, fast, and has low resource requirements. It can be used
to train health personnel or as part of a smartphone application for Bluetooth
stethoscopes.
"
21877,Basic protocols in quantum reinforcement learning with superconducting circuits,"  Superconducting circuit technologies have recently achieved quantum protocols
involving closed feedback loops. Quantum artificial intelligence and quantum
machine learning are emerging fields inside quantum technologies which may
enable quantum devices to acquire information from the outer world and improve
themselves via a learning process. Here we propose the implementation of basic
protocols in quantum reinforcement learning, with superconducting circuits
employing feedback-loop control. We introduce diverse scenarios for
proof-of-principle experiments with state-of-the-art superconducting circuit
technologies and analyze their feasibility in presence of imperfections. The
field of quantum artificial intelligence implemented with superconducting
circuits paves the way for enhanced quantum control and quantum computation
protocols.
"
21878,Feedback Techniques in Computer-Based Simulation Training: A Survey,"  Computer-based simulation training (CBST) is gaining popularity in a vast
range of applications such as surgery, rehabilitation therapy, military
applications, and driver/pilot training, as it offers a low-cost,
easily-accessible and effective training environment. Typically, CBST systems
comprise of two essential components: 1) a simulation environment that provides
an immersive and interactive learning experience, and 2) a feedback
intervention system that supports knowledge/skill acquisition and decision
making. The simulation environment is created using technologies such as
virtual or augmented reality, and this is an area which has gained much
interest in recent years. The provision of automated feedback in CBST however,
has not been investigated as much, and thus, is the focus of this paper.
Feedback is an essential component in learning, and should be provided to the
trainee during the training process in order to improve skills, to correct
mistakes, and most importantly, to inspire reasoning and critical thinking. In
CBST, feedback should be provided in a useful and timely manner, ideally in a
way that mimics the advice of an experienced tutor. Here, we explore the
provision of feedback in CBST from three perspectives: 1) types of feedback to
be provided, 2) presentation modalities of feedback, and 3) methods for
feedback extraction/learning. This review is aimed at providing insight into
how feedback is extracted, organized, and delivered in current applications, to
be used as a guide to the development of future feedback intervention systems
in CBST applications.
"
21879,Robot_gym: accelerated robot training through simulation in the cloud with ROS and Gazebo,"  Rather than programming, training allows robots to achieve behaviors that
generalize better and are capable to respond to real-world needs. However, such
training requires a big amount of experimentation which is not always feasible
for a physical robot. In this work, we present robot_gym, a framework to
accelerate robot training through simulation in the cloud that makes use of
roboticists' tools, simplifying the development and deployment processes on
real robots. We unveil that, for simple tasks, simple 3DoF robots require more
than 140 attempts to learn. For more complex, 6DoF robots, the number of
attempts increases to more than 900 for the same task. We demonstrate that our
framework, for simple tasks, accelerates the robot training time by more than
33% while maintaining similar levels of accuracy and repeatability.
"
21880,Local Modules in Imperative Languages,"  We propose a notion of local modules for imperative langauges. To be
specific, we introduce a new implication statement of the form $D \supset G$
where $D$ is a module (i.e., a set of procedure declarations) and $G$ is a
statement. This statement tells the machine to add $D$ to the program in the
course of executing $G$. Thus, $D$ acts as a local module and will be discarded
after executing $G$. It therefore provides efficient module management. We
illustrate our idea via C^{mod}, an extension of the core C with the new
statement. In addition, we describe a new constructive module language to
improve code reuse. Finally, we describe a scheme which considerably improves
the heap management in traditional languages.
"
21881,Light-induced switching to a Metastable Phase in a Layered Superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (x=0.15),"  We investigated transient optical responses in an optimally-doped high-Tc
superconductor La2-xSrxCuO4 (x=0.15) by using 800-nm optical pump and terahertz
probe spectroscopy. With increasing the photoexcitation intensities, the
Josephson plasma resonance shows a gradual redshift, indicating the suppression
of superconductivity by the photoexcitation. With further increasing the
photoexcitation intensities, a new longitudinal mode in the loss function
spectrum appears and grows from the high energy side, accompanied by a new
transverse mode as manifested in the conductivity spectrum. The observed
spectra are described by the multilayer model with alternating interlayer
Josephson couplings. The new longitudinal and transverse modes sustain much
longer than several hundred picoseconds after the photoexcitation, indicating
that the new metastable phase with possessing alternating interlayer Josephson
couplings is induced by the strong photoexcitation.
"
21882,Fluid Passwords - Mitigating the effects of password leaks at the user level,"  Password leaks have been frequently reported in recent years, with big
companies like Sony, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Walmart falling victim to breaches
involving the release of customer information. Even though passwords are
usually stored in a salted hash, attackers still guess passwords because of
insecure password choices and password reuse. However, the adverse effects of a
password breach can be mitigated by changing users' passwords. We introduce a
simple yet powerful algorithm to reset user account passwords automatically,
while still allowing users to authenticate without any additional effort on
their part. We implemented our algorithm as a Firefox add-on that automatically
resets a user's password when they log in to their account, and stores the new
password in the built-in Firefox password manager.
"
21883,Developer Prioritization in Bug Repositories,"  Developers build all the software artifacts in development. Existing work has
studied the social behavior in software repositories. In one of the most
important software repositories, a bug repository, developers create and update
bug reports to support software development and maintenance. However, no prior
work has considered the priorities of developers in bug repositories. In this
paper, we address the problem of the developer prioritization, which aims to
rank the contributions of developers. We mainly explore two aspects, namely
modeling the developer prioritization in a bug repository and assisting
predictive tasks with our model. First, we model how to assign the priorities
of developers based on a social network technique. Three problems are
investigated, including the developer rankings in products, the evolution over
time, and the tolerance of noisy comments. Second, we consider leveraging the
developer prioritization to improve three predicted tasks in bug repositories,
i.e., bug triage, severity identification, and reopened bug prediction. We
empirically investigate the performance of our model and its applications in
bug repositories of Eclipse and Mozilla. The results indicate that the
developer prioritization can provide the knowledge of developer priorities to
assist software tasks, especially the task of bug triage.
"
21884,Efficient discontinuous Galerkin implementations and preconditioners for implicit unsteady compressible flow simulations,"  This work presents and compares efficient implementations of high-order
discontinuous Galerkin methods: a modal matrix-free discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
method, a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, and a primal
formulation of HDG, applied to the implicit solution of unsteady compressible
flows. The matrix-free implementation allows for a reduction of the memory
footprint of the solver when dealing with implicit time-accurate
discretizations. HDG reduces the number of globally-coupled degrees of freedom
relative to DG, at high order, by statically condensing element-interior
degrees of freedom from the system in favor of face unknowns. The primal
formulation further reduces the element-interior degrees of freedom by
eliminating the gradient as a separate unknown. This paper introduces a
$p$-multigrid preconditioner implementation for these discretizations and
presents results for various flow problems. Benefits of the $p$-multigrid
strategy relative to simpler, less expensive, preconditioners are observed for
stiff systems, such as those arising from low-Mach number flows at high-order
approximation. The $p$-multigrid preconditioner also shows excellent
scalability for parallel computations. Additional savings in both speed and
memory occur with a matrix-free/reduced version of the preconditioner.
"
21885,Coarse cohomology theories,"  We propose the notion of a coarse cohomology theory and study the examples of
coarse ordinary cohomology, coarse stable cohomotopy and coarse cohomology
theories obtained by dualizing coarse homology theories. Our investigations of
coarse stable cohomotopy lead to a solution of J. R. Klein's conjecture that
the dualizing spectrum of a group is a coarse invariant. We further investigate
coarse cohomological $K$-theory functors and explain why (an adaption of) the
functor of Emerson--Meyer does not seem to fit into our setting.
"
21886,A Survey on the Security of Pervasive Online Social Networks (POSNs),"  Pervasive Online Social Networks (POSNs) are the extensions of Online Social
Networks (OSNs) which facilitate connectivity irrespective of the domain and
properties of users. POSNs have been accumulated with the convergence of a
plethora of social networking platforms with a motivation of bridging their
gap. Over the last decade, OSNs have visually perceived an altogether
tremendous amount of advancement in terms of the number of users as well as
technology enablers. A single OSN is the property of an organization, which
ascertains smooth functioning of its accommodations for providing a quality
experience to their users. However, with POSNs, multiple OSNs have coalesced
through communities, circles, or only properties, which make
service-provisioning tedious and arduous to sustain. Especially, challenges
become rigorous when the focus is on the security perspective of cross-platform
OSNs, which are an integral part of POSNs. Thus, it is of utmost paramountcy to
highlight such a requirement and understand the current situation while
discussing the available state-of-the-art. With the modernization of OSNs and
convergence towards POSNs, it is compulsory to understand the impact and reach
of current solutions for enhancing the security of users as well as associated
services. This survey understands this requisite and fixates on different sets
of studies presented over the last few years and surveys them for their
applicability to POSNs...
"
21887,Higher-Order Topological Insulators,"  Three-dimensional topological (crystalline) insulators are materials with an
insulating bulk, but conducting surface states which are topologically
protected by time-reversal (or spatial) symmetries. Here, we extend the notion
of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless
surface states, but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their
topological character is protected by spatio-temporal symmetries, of which we
present two cases: (1) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by
the combination of time-reversal and a four-fold rotation symmetry. Their hinge
states are chiral modes and the bulk topology is $\mathbb{Z}_2$-classified. (2)
Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and
mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs and the bulk
topology is $\mathbb{Z}$-classified. We provide the topological invariants for
both cases. Furthermore we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified
Bi$_2$TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and
propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.
"
21888,Uncertainty Quantification for Maxwell's Eigenproblem using Isogeometric Analysis,"  The electromagnetic field distribution as well as the resonating frequency of
various modes in superconducting cavities used in particle accelerators for
example are sensitive to small geometry deformations. The occurring variations
are motivated by measurements of an available set of resonators from which we
propose to extract a small number of relevant and independent deformations by
using a truncated Karhunen-Loève expansion. The random deformations are used
in an expressive uncertainty quantification workflow to determine the
sensitivity of the eigenmodes. For the propagation of uncertainty, a stochastic
collocation method based on sparse grids is employed. It requires the repeated
solution of Maxwell's eigenvalue problem at predefined collocation points,
i.e., for cavities with perturbed geometry. The main contribution of the paper
is ensuring the consistency of the solution, i.e., matching the eigenpairs,
among the various eigenvalue problems at the stochastic collocation points. To
this end, a classical eigenvalue tracking technique is proposed that is based
on homotopies between collocation points and a Newton-based eigenvalue solver.
The approach can be efficiently parallelized while tracking the eigenpairs. In
this paper, we propose the application of isogeometric analysis since it allows
for the exact description of the geometrical domains with respect to common
computer-aided design kernels, for a straightforward and convenient way of
handling geometrical variations and smooth solutions.
"
21889,Mortality data reliability in an internal model,"  In this paper, we discuss the impact of some mortality data anomalies on an
internal model capturing longevity risk in the Solvency 2 framework. In
particular, we are concerned with abnormal cohort effects such as those for
generations 1919 and 1920, for which the period tables provided by the Human
Mortality Database show particularly low and high mortality rates respectively.
To provide corrected tables for the three countries of interest here (France,
Italy and West Germany), we use the approach developed by Boumezoued (2016) for
countries for which the method applies (France and Italy), and provide an
extension of the method for West Germany as monthly fertility histories are not
sufficient to cover the generations of interest. These mortality tables are
crucial inputs to stochastic mortality models forecasting future scenarios,
from which the extreme 0,5% longevity improvement can be extracted, allowing
for the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). More precisely,
to assess the impact of such anomalies in the Solvency II framework, we use a
simplified internal model based on three usual stochastic models to project
mortality rates in the future combined with a closure table methodology for
older ages. Correcting this bias obviously improves the data quality of the
mortality inputs, which is of paramount importance today, and slightly
decreases the capital requirement. Overall, the longevity risk assessment
remains stable, as well as the selection of the stochastic mortality model. As
a collateral gain of this data quality improvement, the more regular estimated
parameters allow for new insights and a refined assessment regarding longevity
risk.
"
21890,Modularisation of Sequent Calculi for Normal and Non-normal Modalities,"  In this work we explore the connections between (linear) nested sequent
calculi and ordinary sequent calculi for normal and non-normal modal logics. By
proposing local versions to ordinary sequent rules we obtain linear nested
sequent calculi for a number of logics, including to our knowledge the first
nested sequent calculi for a large class of simply dependent multimodal logics,
and for many standard non-normal modal logics. The resulting systems are
modular and have separate left and right introduction rules for the modalities,
which makes them amenable to specification as bipole clauses. While this
granulation of the sequent rules introduces more choices for proof search, we
show how linear nested sequent calculi can be restricted to blocked
derivations, which directly correspond to ordinary sequent derivations.
"
21891,A Probabilistic View of Neighborhood-based Recommendation Methods,"  Probabilistic graphic model is an elegant framework to compactly present
complex real-world observations by modeling uncertainty and logical flow
(conditionally independent factors). In this paper, we present a probabilistic
framework of neighborhood-based recommendation methods (PNBM) in which
similarity is regarded as an unobserved factor. Thus, PNBM leads the estimation
of user preference to maximizing a posterior over similarity. We further
introduce a novel multi-layer similarity descriptor which models and learns the
joint influence of various features under PNBM, and name the new framework
MPNBM. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MPNBM allows very
accurate estimation of user preferences.
"
21892,Magnetic Reconnection in Turbulent Diluted Plasmas,"  We study magnetic reconnection events in a turbulent plasma within the
two-fluid theory. By identifying the diffusive regions, we measure the
reconnection rates as function of the conductivity and current sheet thickness.
We have found that the reconnection rate scales as the squared of the inverse
of the current sheet's thickness and is independent of the aspect ratio of the
diffusive region, in contrast to other analytical, e.g. the Sweet-Parker and
Petscheck, and numerical models. Furthermore, while the reconnection rates are
also proportional to the square inverse of the conductivity, the aspect ratios
of the diffusive regions, which exhibit values in the range of $0.1-0.9$, are
not correlated to the latter. Our findings suggest a new expression for the
magnetic reconnection rate, which, after experimental verification, can provide
a further understanding of the magnetic reconnection process.
"
21893,Intermittency of quantum turbulence with superfluid fractions from 0% to 96%,"  The intermittency of turbulent superfluid helium is explored systematically
in a steady wake flow from 1.28 K up to T>2.18K using a local anemometer. This
temperature range spans relative densities of superfluid from 96% down to 0%,
allowing to test numerical predictions of enhancement or depletion of
intermittency at intermediate superfluid fractions. Using the so-called
extended self-similarity method, scaling exponents of structure functions have
been calculated. No evidence of temperature dependence is found on these
scaling exponents in the upper part of the inertial cascade, where turbulence
is well developed and fully resolved by the probe. This result supports the
picture of a profound analogy between classical and quantum turbulence in their
inertial range, including the violation of self-similarities associated with
inertial-range intermittency.

21894,Toward Interpretable Deep Reinforcement Learning with Linear Model U-Trees,"  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved impressive success in many
applications. A key component of many DRL models is a neural network
representing a Q function, to estimate the expected cumulative reward following
a state-action pair. The Q function neural network contains a lot of implicit
knowledge about the RL problems, but often remains unexamined and
uninterpreted. To our knowledge, this work develops the first mimic learning
framework for Q functions in DRL. We introduce Linear Model U-trees (LMUTs) to
approximate neural network predictions. An LMUT is learned using a novel
on-line algorithm that is well-suited for an active play setting, where the
mimic learner observes an ongoing interaction between the neural net and the
environment. Empirical evaluation shows that an LMUT mimics a Q function
substantially better than five baseline methods. The transparent tree structure
of an LMUT facilitates understanding the network's learned knowledge by
analyzing feature influence, extracting rules, and highlighting the
super-pixels in image inputs.
"
21895,Solution to dynamic economic dispatch with prohibited operating zones via MILP,"  Dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem considering prohibited operating
zones (POZ), ramp rate constraints, transmission losses and spinning reserve
constraints is a complicated non-linear problem which is difficult to solve
efficiently. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method is
proposed to solve such a DED problem. Firstly, a novel MILP formulation for DED
problem without considering the transmission losses, denoted by MILP-1, is
presented by using perspective cut reformulation technique. When the
transmission losses are considered, the quadratic terms in the transmission
losses are replaced by their first order Taylor expansions, and then an MILP
formulation for DED considering the transmission losses, denoted by MILP-2, is
obtained. Based on MILP-1 and MILP-2, an MILP-iteration algorithm (MILP-IA) is
proposed to solve the complicated DED problem. The effectiveness of the MILP-1
and MILP-IA are assessed by several cases and the simulation results show that
both of them can solve to competitive solutions in a short time.
"
21896,Efficient Bayesian Inference of Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Processes,"  We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for estimating the
intensity of a inhomogeneous Poisson process, where the intensity function is
modelled using a Gaussian process (GP) prior via a sigmoid link function.
Augmenting the model using a latent marked Poisson process and Pólya--Gamma
random variables we obtain a representation of the likelihood which is
conjugate to the GP prior. We approximate the posterior using a free--form mean
field approximation together with the framework of sparse GPs. Furthermore, as
alternative approximation we suggest a sparse Laplace approximation of the
posterior, for which an efficient expectation--maximisation algorithm is
derived to find the posterior's mode. Results of both algorithms compare well
with exact inference obtained by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and
standard variational Gauss approach, while being one order of magnitude faster.
"
21897,Perturbation analysis of sub/super hedging problems,"  We investigate the links between various no-arbitrage conditions and the
existence of pricing functionals in general markets, and prove the Fundamental
Theorem of Asset Pricing therein. No-arbitrage conditions, either in this
abstract setting or in the case of a market consisting of European Call
options, give rise to duality properties of infinite-dimensional sub- and
super-hedging problems. With a view towards applications, we show how duality
is preserved when reducing these problems over finite-dimensional bases. We
finally perform a rigorous perturbation analysis of those linear programming
problems, and highlight, as a numerical example, the influence of smile
extrapolation on the bounds of exotic options.
"
21898,Reciprocal Translation between SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Images with Cascaded-Residual Adversarial Networks,"  Despite the advantages of all-weather and all-day high-resolution imaging,
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are much less viewed and used by general
people because human vision is not adapted to microwave scattering phenomenon.
However, expert interpreters can be trained by comparing side-by-side SAR and
optical images to learn the mapping rules from SAR to optical. This paper
attempts to develop machine intelligence that are trainable with large-volume
co-registered SAR and optical images to translate SAR image to optical version
for assisted SAR image interpretation. Reciprocal SAR-Optical image translation
is a challenging task because it is raw data translation between two physically
very different sensing modalities. This paper proposes a novel reciprocal
adversarial network scheme where cascaded residual connections and hybrid
L1-GAN loss are employed. It is trained and tested on both spaceborne GF-3 and
airborne UAVSAR images. Results are presented for datasets of different
resolutions and polarizations and compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
The FID is used to quantitatively evaluate the translation performance. The
possibility of unsupervised learning with unpaired SAR and optical images is
also explored. Results show that the proposed translation network works well
under many scenarios and it could potentially be used for assisted SAR
interpretation.
"
21899,Molecular Computing for Markov Chains,"  In this paper, it is presented a methodology for implementing arbitrarily
constructed time-homogenous Markov chains with biochemical systems. Not only
discrete but also continuous-time Markov chains are allowed to be computed. By
employing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) as a programmable language,
molecular concentrations serve to denote both input and output values. One
reaction network is elaborately designed for each chain. The evolution of
species' concentrations over time well matches the transient solutions of the
target continuous-time Markov chain, while equilibrium concentrations can
indicate the steady state probabilities. Additionally, second-order Markov
chains are considered for implementation, with bimolecular reactions rather
that unary ones. An original scheme is put forward to compile unimolecular
systems to DNA strand displacement reactions for the sake of future physical
implementations. Deterministic, stochastic and DNA simulations are provided to
enhance correctness, validity and feasibility.
"
21900,Theory of ground states for classical Heisenberg spin systems III,"  We extend the theory of ground states of classical Heisenberg spin systems
published previously by a closer investigation of the convex Gram set of $N$
spins. This is relevant for the present purpose since the set of ground states
of a given spin system corresponds to a face of Gram set. The investigation of
the Gram set is facilitated by the determination of its symmetry group. The
case of the general spin triangle is completely solved and illustrated by a
couple of examples.
"
21901,Dynamical Isometry and a Mean Field Theory of RNNs: Gating Enables Signal Propagation in Recurrent Neural Networks,"  Recurrent neural networks have gained widespread use in modeling sequence
data across various domains. While many successful recurrent architectures
employ a notion of gating, the exact mechanism that enables such remarkable
performance is not well understood. We develop a theory for signal propagation
in recurrent networks after random initialization using a combination of mean
field theory and random matrix theory. To simplify our discussion, we introduce
a new RNN cell with a simple gating mechanism that we call the minimalRNN and
compare it with vanilla RNNs. Our theory allows us to define a maximum
timescale over which RNNs can remember an input. We show that this theory
predicts trainability for both recurrent architectures. We show that gated
recurrent networks feature a much broader, more robust, trainable region than
vanilla RNNs, which corroborates recent experimental findings. Finally, we
develop a closed-form critical initialization scheme that achieves dynamical
isometry in both vanilla RNNs and minimalRNNs. We show that this results in
significantly improvement in training dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that
the minimalRNN achieves comparable performance to its more complex
counterparts, such as LSTMs or GRUs, on a language modeling task.
"
21902,Foundation of relativistic astrophysics: Curvature of Riemannian Space versus Relativistic Quantum Field in Minkowski Space,"  The common basis for many high energy astrophysical phenomena is the theory
of gravitation, for which in modern theoretical physics there are two main
directions: Einstein's geometrical and Feynman's nonmetric field approaches for
description of gravitational interaction. Though classical relativistic effects
have the same values in both approaches, there are dramatically different
effects predicted by GRT and FGT for relativistic astrophysics. Crucial
observational tests which allow to test the physics of the gravitational
interaction are discussed, including detection of gravitational waves by
advanced LIGO-Virgo antennas and Event Horizon Telescope observations of active
galactic nuclei. Forthcoming relativistic astrophysics can open new ways in
understanding of gravitation and the unification of fundamental physical
interaction.
"
21903,Consistency of survival tree and forest models: splitting bias and correction,"  Random survival forest and survival trees are popular models in statistics
and machine learning. However, there is a lack of general understanding
regarding consistency, splitting rules and influence of the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the statistical properties of existing
methods from several interesting perspectives. First, we show that traditional
splitting rules with censored outcomes rely on a biased estimation of the
within-node failure distribution. To exactly quantify this bias, we develop a
concentration bound of the within-node estimation based on non i.i.d. samples
and apply it to the entire forest. Second, we analyze the entanglement between
the failure and censoring distributions caused by univariate splits, and show
that without correcting the bias at an internal node, survival tree and forest
models can still enjoy consistency under suitable conditions. In particular, we
demonstrate this property under two cases: a finite-dimensional case where the
splitting variables and cutting points are chosen randomly, and a
high-dimensional case where the covariates are weakly correlated. Our results
can also degenerate into an independent covariate setting, which is commonly
used in the random forest literature for high-dimensional sparse models.
However, it may not be avoidable that the convergence rate depends on the total
number of variables in the failure and censoring distributions. Third, we
propose a new splitting rule that compares bias-corrected cumulative hazard
functions at each internal node. We show that the rate of consistency of this
new model depends only on the number of failure variables, which improves from
non-bias-corrected versions. We perform simulation studies to confirm that this
can substantially benefit the prediction error.
"
21904,Missing Data and Prediction,"  Missing data are a common problem for both the construction and
implementation of a prediction algorithm. Pattern mixture kernel submodels
(PMKS) - a series of submodels for every missing data pattern that are fit
using only data from that pattern - are a computationally efficient remedy for
both stages. Here we show that PMKS yield the most predictive algorithm among
all standard missing data strategies. Specifically, we show that the expected
loss of a forecasting algorithm is minimized when each pattern-specific loss is
minimized. Simulations and a re-analysis of the SUPPORT study confirms that
PMKS generally outperforms zero-imputation, mean-imputation, complete-case
analysis, complete-case submodels, and even multiple imputation (MI). The
degree of improvement is highly dependent on the missingness mechanism and the
effect size of missing predictors. When the data are Missing at Random (MAR) MI
can yield comparable forecasting performance but generally requires a larger
computational cost. We see that predictions from the PMKS are equivalent to the
limiting predictions for a MI procedure that uses a mean model dependent on
missingness indicators (the MIMI model). Consequently, the MIMI model can be
used to assess the MAR assumption in practice. The focus of this paper is on
out-of-sample prediction behavior, implications for model inference are only
briefly explored.
"
21905,Multidimensional Urban Segregation - Toward A Neural Network Measure,"  We introduce a multidimensional, neural-network approach to reveal and
measure urban segregation phenomena, based on the Self-Organizing Map algorithm
(SOM). The multidimensionality of SOM allows one to apprehend a large number of
variables simultaneously, defined on census or other types of statistical
blocks, and to perform clustering along them. Levels of segregation are then
measured through correlations between distances on the neural network and
distances on the actual geographical map. Further, the stochasticity of SOM
enables one to quantify levels of heterogeneity across census blocks. We
illustrate this new method on data available for the city of Paris.
"
21906,Reconstructing networks with unknown and heterogeneous errors,"  The vast majority of network datasets contains errors and omissions, although
this is rarely incorporated in traditional network analysis. Recently, an
increasing effort has been made to fill this methodological gap by developing
network reconstruction approaches based on Bayesian inference. These
approaches, however, rely on assumptions of uniform error rates and on direct
estimations of the existence of each edge via repeated measurements, something
that is currently unavailable for the majority of network data. Here we develop
a Bayesian reconstruction approach that lifts these limitations by not only
allowing for heterogeneous errors, but also for single edge measurements
without direct error estimates. Our approach works by coupling the inference
approach with structured generative network models, which enable the
correlations between edges to be used as reliable uncertainty estimates.
Although our approach is general, we focus on the stochastic block model as the
basic generative process, from which efficient nonparametric inference can be
performed, and yields a principled method to infer hierarchical community
structure from noisy data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a
variety of empirical and artificial networks.
"
21907,Distributed Active State Estimation with User-Specified Accuracy,"  In this paper, we address the problem of controlling a network of mobile
sensors so that a set of hidden states are estimated up to a user-specified
accuracy. The sensors take measurements and fuse them online using an
Information Consensus Filter (ICF). At the same time, the local estimates guide
the sensors to their next best configuration. This leads to an LMI-constrained
optimization problem that we solve by means of a new distributed random
approximate projections method. The new method is robust to the state
disagreement errors that exist among the robots as the ICF fuses the collected
measurements. Assuming that the noise corrupting the measurements is zero-mean
and Gaussian and that the robots are self localized in the environment, the
integrated system converges to the next best positions from where new
observations will be taken. This process is repeated with the robots taking a
sequence of observations until the hidden states are estimated up to the
desired user-specified accuracy. We present simulations of sparse landmark
localization, where the robotic team achieves the desired estimation tolerances
while exhibiting interesting emergent behavior.
"
21908,The Generalized Nagell-Ljunggren Problem: Powers with Repetitive Representations,"  We consider a natural generalization of the Nagell-Ljunggren equation to the
case where the qth power of an integer y, for q >= 2, has a base-b
representation that consists of a length-l block of digits repeated n times,
where n >= 2. Assuming the abc conjecture of Masser and Oesterlé, we
completely characterize those triples (q, n, l) for which there are infinitely
many solutions b. In all cases predicted by the abc conjecture, we are able
(without any assumptions) to prove there are indeed infinitely many solutions.
"
21909,Observing the sky at extremely high energies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array: Status of the GCT project,"  The Cherenkov Telescope Array is the main global project of ground-based
gamma-ray astronomy for the coming decades. Performance will be significantly
improved relative to present instruments, allowing a new insight into the
high-energy Universe [1]. The nominal CTA southern array will include a
sub-array of seventy 4 m telescopes spread over a few square kilometers to
study the sky at extremely high energies, with the opening of a new window in
the multi-TeV energy range. The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is one of
the proposed telescope designs for that sub-array. The GCT prototype recorded
its first Cherenkov light on sky in 2015. After an assessment phase in 2016,
new observations have been performed successfully in 2017. The GCT
collaboration plans to install its first telescopes and cameras on the CTA site
in Chile in 2018-2019 and to contribute a number of telescopes to the
subsequent CTA production phase.
"
21910,"Light bending, static dark energy and related uniqueness of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime","  Since the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is static inside the cosmological
event horizon, if the dark energy state parameter is sufficiently close to
$-1$, apparently one could still expect an effectively static geometry, in the
attraction dominated region inside the maximum turn around radius, $R_{\rm TA,
max}$, of a cosmic structure. We take the first order metric derived recently
assuming a static and ideal dark energy fluid with equation of state
$P(r)=\alpha\rho(r)$ as a source in Ref. [1], which reproduced the expression
for $R_{\rm TA, max}$ found earlier in the cosmological McVittie spacetime.
Here we show that the equality originates from the equivalence of geodesic
motion in these two backgrounds, in the non-relativistic regime. We extend this
metric up to the third order and compute the bending of light using the
Rindler-Ishak method. For $ \alpha\neq -1$, a dark energy dependent term
appears in the bending equation, unlike the case of the cosmological constant,
$\alpha=-1$. Due to this new term in particular, existing data for the light
bending at galactic scales yields, $(1+\alpha)\lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-14})$,
thereby practically ruling out any such static and inhomogeneous dark energy
fluid we started with. Implication of this result pertaining the uniqueness of
the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in such inhomogeneous dark energy
background is discussed.
"
21911,Free multivariate w*-semicrossed products: reflexivity and the bicommutant property,"  We study w*-semicrossed products over actions of the free semigroup and the
free abelian semigroup on (possibly non-selfadjoint) w*-closed algebras. We
show that they are reflexive when the dynamics are implemented by uniformly
bounded families of invertible row operators. Combining with results of Helmer
we derive that w*-semicrossed products over factors (on a separable Hilbert
space) are reflexive. Furthermore we show that w*-semicrossed products of
automorphic actions on maximal abelian selfadjoint algebras are reflexive. In
all cases we prove that the w*-semicrossed products have the bicommutant
property if and only if so does the ambient algebra of the dynamics.
"
21912,Computation and theory of Euler sums of generalized hyperharmonic numbers,"  Recently, Dil and Boyadzhiev \cite{AD2015} proved an explicit formula for the
sum of multiple harmonic numbers whose indices are the sequence $\left(
{{\left\{ 0 \right\}_r},1} \right)$. In this paper we show that the sums of
multiple harmonic numbers whose indices are the sequence $\left( {{\left\{ 0
\right\}_r,1};{\left\{ 1 \right\}_{k-1}}} \right)$ can be expressed in terms
of (multiple) zeta values, multiple harmonic numbers and Stirling numbers of
the first kind, and give an explicit formula.
"
21913,A Lightweight Music Texture Transfer System,"  Deep learning researches on the transformation problems for image and text
have raised great attention. However, present methods for music feature
transfer using neural networks are far from practical application. In this
paper, we initiate a novel system for transferring the texture of music, and
release it as an open source project. Its core algorithm is composed of a
converter which represents sounds as texture spectra, a corresponding
reconstructor and a feed-forward transfer network. We evaluate this system from
multiple perspectives, and experimental results reveal that it achieves
convincing results in both sound effects and computational performance.
"
21914,Assessment of Bayesian Expected Power via Bayesian Bootstrap,"  The Bayesian expected power (BEP) has become increasingly popular in sample
size determination and assessment of the probability of success (POS) for a
future trial. The BEP takes into consideration the uncertainty around the
parameters assumed by a power analysis and is thus more robust compared to the
traditional power that assumes a single set of parameters. Current methods for
assessing BEP are often based in a parametric framework by imposing a model on
the pilot data to derive and sample from the posterior distributions of the
parameters. Implementation of the model-based approaches can be analytically
challenging and computationally costly especially for multivariate data sets;
it also runs the risk of generating misleading BEP if the model is
mis-specified. We propose an approach based on the Bayesian bootstrap technique
(BBS) to simulate future trials in the presence of individual-level pilot data,
based on which the empirical BEP can be calculated. The BBS approach is
model-free with no assumptions about the distribution of the prior data and
circumvents the analytical and computational complexity associated with
obtaining the posterior distribution of the parameters. Information from
multiple pilot studies is also straightforward to combine. We also propose the
double bootstrap (BS2), a frequentist counterpart to the BBS, that shares
similar properties and achieves the same goal as the BBS for BEP assessment.
Simulation studies and case studies are presented to demonstrate the
implementation of the BBS and BS2 techniques and to compare the BEP results
with model-based approaches.
"
21915,The EBLM Project IV. Spectroscopic orbits of over 100 eclipsing M dwarfs masquerading as transiting hot-Jupiters,"  We present 2271 radial velocity measurements taken on 118 single-line binary
stars, taken over eight years with the CORALIE spectrograph. The binaries
consist of F/G/K primaries and M-dwarf secondaries. They were initially
discovered photometrically by the WASP planet survey, as their shallow eclipses
mimic a hot-Jupiter transit. The observations we present permit a precise
characterisation of the binary orbital elements and mass function. With
modelling of the primary star this mass function is converted to a mass of the
secondary star. In the future, this spectroscopic work will be combined with
precise photometric eclipses to draw an empirical mass/radius relation for the
bottom of the mass sequence. This has applications in both stellar astrophysics
and the growing number of exoplanet surveys around M-dwarfs. In particular, we
have discovered 34 systems with a secondary mass below $0.2 M_\odot$, and so we
will ultimately double the known number of very low-mass stars with well
characterised mass and radii.
We are able to detect eccentricities as small as 0.001 and orbital periods to
sub-second precision. Our sample can revisit some earlier work on the tidal
evolution of close binaries, extending it to low mass ratios. We find some
binaries that are eccentric at orbital periods < 3 days, while our longest
circular orbit has a period of 10.4 days.
By collating the EBLM binaries with published WASP planets and brown dwarfs,
we derive a mass spectrum with twice the resolution of previous work. We
compare the WASP/EBLM sample of tightly-bound orbits with work in the
literature on more distant companions up to 10 AU. We note that the brown dwarf
desert appears wider, as it carves into the planetary domain for our
short-period orbits. This would mean that a significantly reduced abundance of
planets begins at $\sim 3M_{\rm Jup}$, well before the Deuterium-burning limit.

"
21916,Causal Inference from Observational Studies with Clustered Interference,"  Inferring causal effects from an observational study is challenging because
participants are not randomized to treatment. Observational studies in
infectious disease research present the additional challenge that one
participant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i.e., there
may be interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects
in the presence of interference are considered, and new causal estimands
designed specifically for use with observational studies are proposed.
Previously defined estimands target counterfactual scenarios in which
individuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in
settings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it
may be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in
the same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe counterfactual
scenarios in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as
in the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in
the individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for
policy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of
increasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse
probability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The
large-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study
demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented. The
proposed methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a study of cholera
vaccination in over 100,000 individuals in Bangladesh.
"
21917,Sequential Dynamic Decision Making with Deep Neural Nets on a Test-Time Budget,"  Deep neural network (DNN) based approaches hold significant potential for
reinforcement learning (RL) and have already shown remarkable gains over
state-of-art methods in a number of applications. The effectiveness of DNN
methods can be attributed to leveraging the abundance of supervised data to
learn value functions, Q-functions, and policy function approximations without
the need for feature engineering. Nevertheless, the deployment of DNN-based
predictors with very deep architectures can pose an issue due to computational
and other resource constraints at test-time in a number of applications. We
propose a novel approach for reducing the average latency by learning a
computationally efficient gating function that is capable of recognizing states
in a sequential decision process for which policy prescriptions of a shallow
network suffices and deeper layers of the DNN have little marginal utility. The
overall system is adaptive in that it dynamically switches control actions
based on state-estimates in order to reduce average latency without sacrificing
terminal performance. We experiment with a number of alternative loss-functions
to train gating functions and shallow policies and show that in a number of
applications a speed-up of up to almost 5X can be obtained with little loss in
performance.
"
21918,Linear Representation of Symmetric Games,"  Using semi-tensor product of matrices, the structures of several kinds of
symmetric games are investigated via the linear representation of symmetric
group in the structure vector of games as its representation space. First of
all, the symmetry, described as the action of symmetric group on payoff
functions, is converted into the product of permutation matrices with structure
vectors of payoff functions. Using the linear representation of the symmetric
group in structure vectors, the algebraic conditions for the ordinary,
weighted, renaming and name-irrelevant symmetries are obtained respectively as
the invariance under the corresponding linear representations. Secondly, using
the linear representations the relationship between symmetric games and
potential games is investigated. This part is mainly focused on Boolean games.
An alternative proof is given to show that ordinary, renaming and weighted
symmetric Boolean games are also potential ones under our framework. The
corresponding potential functions are also obtained. Finally, an example is
given to show that some other Boolean games could also be potential games.
"
21919,Snorkel: Rapid Training Data Creation with Weak Supervision,"  Labeling training data is increasingly the largest bottleneck in deploying
machine learning systems. We present Snorkel, a first-of-its-kind system that
enables users to train state-of-the-art models without hand labeling any
training data. Instead, users write labeling functions that express arbitrary
heuristics, which can have unknown accuracies and correlations. Snorkel
denoises their outputs without access to ground truth by incorporating the
first end-to-end implementation of our recently proposed machine learning
paradigm, data programming. We present a flexible interface layer for writing
labeling functions based on our experience over the past year collaborating
with companies, agencies, and research labs. In a user study, subject matter
experts build models 2.8x faster and increase predictive performance an average
45.5% versus seven hours of hand labeling. We study the modeling tradeoffs in
this new setting and propose an optimizer for automating tradeoff decisions
that gives up to 1.8x speedup per pipeline execution. In two collaborations,
with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, and on four open-source text and image data sets representative
of other deployments, Snorkel provides 132% average improvements to predictive
performance over prior heuristic approaches and comes within an average 3.60%
of the predictive performance of large hand-curated training sets.
"
21920,Efficient assembly based on B-spline tailored quadrature rules for the IgA-SGBEM,"  This paper deals with the discrete counterpart of 2D elliptic model problems
rewritten in terms of Boundary Integral Equations. The study is done within the
framework of Isogeometric Analysis based on B-splines. In such a context, the
problem of constructing appropriate, accurate and efficient quadrature rules
for the Symmetric Galerkin Boundary Element Method is here investigated. The
new integration schemes, together with row assembly and sum factorization, are
used to build a more efficient strategy to derive the final linear system of
equations. Key ingredients are weighted quadrature rules tailored for
B--splines, that are constructed to be exact in the whole test space, also with
respect to the singular kernel. Several simulations are presented and
discussed, showing accurate evaluation of the involved integrals and outlining
the superiority of the new approach in terms of computational cost and elapsed
time with respect to the standard element-by-element assembly.
"
21921,Perceptual audio loss function for deep learning,"  PESQ and POLQA , are standards are standards for automated assessment of
voice quality of speech as experienced by human beings. The predictions of
those objective measures should come as close as possible to subjective quality
scores as obtained in subjective listening tests. Wavenet is a deep neural
network originally developed as a deep generative model of raw audio
wave-forms. Wavenet architecture is based on dilated causal convolutions, which
exhibit very large receptive fields. In this short paper we suggest using the
Wavenet architecture, in particular its large receptive filed in order to learn
PESQ algorithm. By doing so we can use it as a differentiable loss function for
speech enhancement.
"
21922,From Complex Event Processing to Simple Event Processing,"  Many problems in Computer Science can be framed as the computation of queries
over sequences, or ""streams"" of data units called events. The field of Complex
Event Processing (CEP) relates to the techniques and tools developed to
efficiently process these queries. However, most CEP systems developed so far
have concentrated on relatively narrow types of queries, which consist of
sliding windows, aggregation functions, and simple sequential patterns computed
over events that have a fixed tuple structure. Many of them boast throughput,
but in counterpart, they are difficult to setup and cumbersome to extend with
user-defined elements.
This paper describes a variety of use cases taken from real-world scenarios
that present features seldom considered in classical CEP problems. It also
provides a broad review of current solutions, that includes tools and
techniques going beyond typical surveys on CEP. From a critical analysis of
these solutions, design principles for a new type of event stream processing
system are exposed. The paper proposes a simple, generic and extensible
framework for the processing of event streams of diverse types; it describes in
detail a stream processing engine, called BeepBeep, that implements these
principles. BeepBeep's modular architecture, which borrows concepts from many
other systems, is complemented with an extensible query language, called eSQL.
The end result is an open, versatile, and reasonably efficient query engine
that can be used in situations that go beyond the capabilities of existing
systems.
"
21923,Differentially Private Empirical Risk Minimization with Input Perturbation,"  We propose a novel framework for the differentially private ERM, input
perturbation. Existing differentially private ERM implicitly assumed that the
data contributors submit their private data to a database expecting that the
database invokes a differentially private mechanism for publication of the
learned model. In input perturbation, each data contributor independently
randomizes her/his data by itself and submits the perturbed data to the
database. We show that the input perturbation framework theoretically
guarantees that the model learned with the randomized data eventually satisfies
differential privacy with the prescribed privacy parameters. At the same time,
input perturbation guarantees that local differential privacy is guaranteed to
the server. We also show that the excess risk bound of the model learned with
input perturbation is $O(1/n)$ under a certain condition, where $n$ is the
sample size. This is the same as the excess risk bound of the state-of-the-art.
"
21924,Empirical Distribution of Scaled Eigenvalues for Product of Matrices from the Spherical Ensemble,"  Consider the product of $m$ independent $n\times n$ random matrices from the
spherical ensemble for $m\ge 1$. The empirical distribution based on the $n$
eigenvalues of the product is called the empirical spectral distribution. Two
recent papers by Götze, Kösters and Tikhomirov (2015) and Zeng (2016)
obtain the limit of the empirical spectral distribution for the product when
$m$ is a fixed integer. In this paper, we investigate the limiting empirical
distribution of scaled eigenvalues for the product of $m$ independent matrices
from the spherical ensemble in the case when $m$ changes with $n$, that is,
$m=m_n$ is an arbitrary sequence of positive integers.
"
21925,Pulsed high magnetic field measurement via a Rubidium vapor sensor,"  We present a new technique to measure pulsed magnetic fields based on the use
of Rubidium in gas phase as a metrological standard. We have therefore
developed an instrument based on laser inducing transitions at about 780~nm (D2
line) in a Rubidium gas contained in a mini-cell of 3~mm~x~3~mm cross section.
To be able to insert such a cell in a standard high field pulsed magnet we have
realized a fibred probe kept at a fixed temperature. Transition frequencies for
both the $\pi$ (light polarization parallel to the magnetic field) and $\sigma$
(light polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field) configurations are
measured by a commercial wavemeter. One innovation of our sensor is that in
addition of monitoring the light transmitted by the Rb cell, which is usual, we
also monitor the fluorescence emission of the gas sample from a very small
volume with the advantage of reducing the impact of the field inhomogeneity on
the field measurement. Our sensor has been tested up to about 58~T.

21926,A Massive Shell of Supernova-formed Dust in SNR G54.1+0.3,"  While theoretical dust condensation models predict that most refractory
elements produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) efficiently condense into
dust, a large quantity of dust has so far only been observed in SN 1987A. We
present the analysis of Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory,
Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and AKARI
observations of the infrared (IR) shell surrounding the pulsar wind nebula in
the supernova remnant G54.1+0.3. We attribute a distinctive spectral feature at
21 $\mu$m to a magnesium silicate grain species that has been invoked in
modeling the ejecta-condensed dust in Cas A, which exhibits the same spectral
signature. If this species is responsible for producing the observed spectral
feature and accounts for a significant fraction of the observed IR continuum,
we find that it would be the dominant constituent of the dust in G54.1+0.3,
with possible secondary contributions from other compositions, such as carbon,
silicate, or alumina grains. The smallest mass of SN-formed dust required by
our models is 1.1 $\pm$ 0.8 $\rm M_{\odot}$. We discuss how these results may
be affected by varying dust grain properties and self-consistent grain heating
models. The spatial distribution of the dust mass and temperature in G54.1+0.3
confirms the scenario in which the SN-formed dust has not yet been processed by
the SN reverse shock and is being heated by stars belonging to a cluster in
which the SN progenitor exploded. The dust mass and composition suggest a
progenitor mass of 16$-$27 $\rm M_{\odot}$ and imply a high dust condensation
efficiency, similar to that found for Cas A and SN 1987A. The study provides
another example of significant dust formation in a Type IIP SN and sheds light
on the properties of pristine SN-condensed dust.
"
21927,A Purely Functional Computer Algebra System Embedded in Haskell,"  We demonstrate how methods in Functional Programming can be used to implement
a computer algebra system. As a proof-of-concept, we present the
computational-algebra package. It is a computer algebra system implemented as
an embedded domain-specific language in Haskell, a purely functional
programming language. Utilising methods in functional programming and prominent
features of Haskell, this library achieves safety, composability, and
correctness at the same time. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, we
have implemented advanced Gröbner basis algorithms, such as Faugère's
$F_4$ and $F_5$, in a composable way.
"
21928,Weight recursions for any rotation symmetric Boolean functions,"  Let $f_n(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ denote the algebraic normal form (polynomial
form) of a rotation symmetric Boolean function of degree $d$ in $n \geq d$
variables and let $wt(f_n)$ denote the Hamming weight of this function. Let
$(1, a_2, \ldots, a_d)_n$ denote the function $f_n$ of degree $d$ in $n$
variables generated by the monomial $x_1x_{a_2} \cdots x_{a_d}.$ Such a
function $f_n$ is called {\em monomial rotation symmetric} (MRS). It was proved
in a $2012$ paper that for any MRS $f_n$ with $d=3,$ the sequence of weights
$\{w_k = wt(f_k):~k = 3, 4, \ldots\}$ satisfies a homogeneous linear recursion
with integer coefficients. In this paper it is proved that such recursions
exist for any rotation symmetric function $f_n;$ such a function is generated
by some sum of $t$ monomials of various degrees. The last section of the paper
gives a Mathematica program which explicitly computes the homogeneous linear
recursion for the weights, given any rotation symmetric $f_n.$ The reader who
is only interested in finding some recursions can use the program and not be
concerned with the details of the rather complicated proofs in this paper.
"
21929,Generalized forbidden subposet problems,"  A subfamily $\{F_1,F_2,\dots,F_{|P|}\}\subseteq {\cal F}$ of sets is a copy
of a poset $P$ in ${\cal F}$ if there exists a bijection $\phi:P\rightarrow
\{F_1,F_2,\dots,F_{|P|}\}$ such that whenever $x \le_P x'$ holds, then so does
$\phi(x)\subseteq \phi(x')$. For a family ${\cal F}$ of sets, let $c(P,{\cal
F})$ denote the number of copies of $P$ in ${\cal F}$, and we say that ${\cal
F}$ is $P$-free if $c(P,{\cal F})=0$ holds. For any two posets $P,Q$ let us
denote by $La(n,P,Q)$ the maximum number of copies of $Q$ over all $P$-free
families ${\cal F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, i.e. $\max\{c(Q,{\cal F}): {\cal F}
\subseteq 2^{[n]}, c(P,{\cal F})=0 \}$.
This generalizes the well-studied parameter $La(n,P)=La(n,P,P_1)$ where $P_1$
is the one element poset. The quantity $La(n,P)$ has been determined (precisely
or asymptotically) for many posets $P$, and in all known cases an
asymptotically best construction can be obtained by taking as many middle
levels as possible without creating a copy of $P$.
In this paper we consider the first instances of the problem of determining
$La(n,P,Q)$. We find its value when $P$ and $Q$ are small posets, like chains,
forks, the $N$ poset and diamonds. Already these special cases show that the
extremal families are completely different from those in the original $P$-free
cases: sometimes not middle or consecutive levels maximize $La(n,P,Q)$ and
sometimes no asymptotically extremal family is the union of levels.
Finally, we determine the maximum number of copies of complete multi-level
posets in $k$-Sperner families. The main tools for this are the profile
polytope method and two extremal set system problems that are of independent
interest: we maximize the number of $r$-tuples $A_1,A_2,\dots, A_r \in {\cal
A}$ over all antichains ${\cal A}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ such that (i)
$\cap_{i=1}^rA_i=\emptyset$, (ii) $\cap_{i=1}^rA_i=\emptyset$ and
$\cup_{i=1}^rA_i=[n]$.
"
21930,Radiative Heat Transfer Between Core-Shell Nanoparticles,"  Radiative heat transfer in systems with core-shell nanoparticles may exhibit
not only a combination of disparate physical properties of its components but
also further enhanced properties that arise from the synergistic properties of
the core and shell components. We study the thermal conductance between two
core-shell nanoparticles (CSNPs). The contribution of electric and magnetic
dipole moments to the thermal conductance depend sensitively on the core and
shell materials, and adjustable by core size and shell thickness. We predict
that the radiative heat transfer in a dimer of Au@SiO2 CSNPs (i.e.,
silica-coated gold nanoparticles) could be enhanced several order of magnitude
compared to bare Au nanoparticles. However, the reduction of several orders of
magnitude in the heat transfer is possible between SiO2@Au CSNPs (i.e., silica
as a core and gold as a shell) than that of uncoated SiO2 nanoparticles.
"
21931,Robust Rigid Point Registration based on Convolution of Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models,"  Matching 3D rigid point clouds in complex environments robustly and
accurately is still a core technique used in many applications. This paper
proposes a new architecture combining error estimation from sample covariances
and dual global probability alignment based on the convolution of adaptive
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) from point clouds. Firstly, a novel adaptive GMM
is defined using probability distributions from the corresponding points. Then
rigid point cloud alignment is performed by maximizing the global probability
from the convolution of dual adaptive GMMs in the whole 2D or 3D space, which
can be efficiently optimized and has a large zone of accurate convergence.
Thousands of trials have been conducted on 200 models from public 2D and 3D
datasets to demonstrate superior robustness and accuracy in complex
environments with unpredictable noise, outliers, occlusion, initial rotation,
shape and missing points.
"
21932,Attitudes of Children with Autism towards Robots: An Exploratory Study,"  In this exploratory study we assessed how attitudes of children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) towards robots together with children's autism-related
social impairments are linked to indicators of children's preference of an
interaction with a robot over an interaction with a person. We found that
children with ASD have overall positive attitudes towards robots and that they
often prefer interacting with a robot than with a person. Several of children's
attitudes were linked to children's longer gazes towards a robot compared to a
person. Autism-related social impairments were linked to more repetitive and
stereotyped behaviors and to a shorter gaze duration in the interaction with
the robot compared to the person. These preliminary results contribute to
better understand factors that might help determine sub-groups of children with
ASD for whom robots could be particularly useful.
"
21933,Electromagnetic dipole moments of charged baryons with bent crystals at the LHC,"  We propose a unique program of measurements of electric and magnetic dipole
moments of charm, beauty and strange charged baryons at the LHC, based on the
phenomenon of spin precession of channeled particles in bent crystals. Studies
of crystal channeling and spin precession of positively- and negatively-charged
particles are presented, along with feasibility studies and expected
sensitivities for the proposed experiment using a layout based on the LHCb
detector.
"
21934,Distributed Gauss-Newton Method for State Estimation Using Belief Propagation,"  We present a novel distributed Gauss-Newton method for the non-linear state
estimation (SE) model based on a probabilistic inference method called belief
propagation (BP). The main novelty of our work comes from applying BP
sequentially over a sequence of linear approximations of the SE model, akin to
what is done by the Gauss-Newton method. The resulting iterative Gauss-Newton
belief propagation (GN-BP) algorithm can be interpreted as a distributed
Gauss-Newton method with the same accuracy as the centralized SE, however,
introducing a number of advantages of the BP framework. The paper provides
extensive numerical study of the GN-BP algorithm, provides details on its
convergence behavior, and gives a number of useful insights for its
implementation.
"
21935,A two-dimensional index to quantify both scientific research impact and scope,"  Modern management of research is increasingly based on quantitative
bibliometric indices. Nowadays, the h-index is a major measure of research
output that has supplanted all other citation-based indices. In this context,
indicators that complement the h-index by evaluating different facets of
research achievement are compelling. As an additional bibliometric source that
can be easily extracted from available databases, we propose to use the number
of distinct journals Nj in which an individual's papers were published. We show
that Nj is independent of citation counts, and argue that it is a relevant
indicator of research scope, since it quantifies readership extent and
scientific multidisciplinarity. Combining the h-index and Nj, we define a
two-dimensional index (H,M) that measures both the output (through H) and the
outreach (through M) of individual's research. In order to probe the relevance
of this two dimensional index, we have analysed the scientific production of a
panel of physicists belonging to the same Department but with different
research themes. The analysis of bibliometric data confirms that the two
indices are uncorrelated and shows that while H reliably ranks the impact of
researchers, M accurately sorts multidisciplinary or readership aspects. We
conclude that the two indices together offer a more complete picture of
research performance and can be applied to either individuals, research groups
or institutions.
"
21936,"Dynamic programming algorithms, efficient solution of the LP-relaxation and approximation schemes for the Penalized Knapsack Problem","  We consider the 0-1 Penalized Knapsack Problem (PKP). Each item has a profit,
a weight and a penalty and the goal is to maximize the sum of the profits minus
the greatest penalty value of the items included in a solution. We propose an
exact approach relying on a procedure which narrows the relevant range of
penalties, on the identification of a core problem and on dynamic programming.
The proposed approach turns out to be very effective in solving hard instances
of PKP and compares favorably both to commercial solver CPLEX 12.5 applied to
the ILP formulation of the problem and to the best available exact algorithm in
the literature. Then we present a general inapproximability result and
investigate several relevant special cases which permit fully polynomial time
approximation schemes (FPTASs).
"
21937,Non-reciprocal Light-harvesting Nanoantennae Made by Nature,"  From a point of view of classical electrodynamics, the performance of
two-dimensional shape-simplified antennae is discussed based upon the shape of
naturally designed systems to harvest light. We explain the reason that the
function of the notch at the complex, the function of the PufX presented at the
notch, the function of the special pair, the bacteriochlorophylls are
dielectric instead of conductor, and a mechanism to prevent damages from excess
sunlight. The non-heme iron at the reaction center, the toroidal shape of the
light harvestor, the functional role played by the long-lasting spectrometric
signal observed, and the photon anti-bunching observed suggest non-reciprocity.
Our model has the required structural information automatically built in. We
further comment about how our prediction might be verified experimentally.
"
21938,Analysis of a SIRI epidemic model with distributed delay and relapse,"  We investigate the global behaviour of a SIRI epidemic model with distributed
delay and relapse. From the theory of functional differential equations with
delay, we prove that the solution of the system is unique, bounded, and
positive, for all time. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ for the model is
computed. By means of the direct Lyapunov method and LaSalle invariance
principle, we prove that the disease free equilibrium is globally
asymptotically stable when $R_{0} < 1$. Moreover, we show that there is a
unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable, when
$R_{0} > 1$.
"
21939,TensOrMachine: Probabilistic Boolean Tensor Decomposition,"  Boolean tensor decomposition approximates data of multi-way binary
relationships as product of interpretable low-rank binary factors, following
the rules of Boolean algebra. Here, we present its first probabilistic
treatment. We facilitate scalable sampling-based posterior inference by
exploitation of the combinatorial structure of the factor conditionals. Maximum
a posteriori decompositions feature higher accuracies than existing techniques
throughout a wide range of simulated conditions. Moreover, the probabilistic
approach facilitates the treatment of missing data and enables model selection
with much greater accuracy. We investigate three real-world data-sets. First,
temporal interaction networks in a hospital ward and behavioural data of
university students demonstrate the inference of instructive latent patterns.
Next, we decompose a tensor with more than 10 billion data points, indicating
relations of gene expression in cancer patients. Not only does this demonstrate
scalability, it also provides an entirely novel perspective on relational
properties of continuous data and, in the present example, on the molecular
heterogeneity of cancer. Our implementation is available on GitHub:

"
21940,Word Embeddings: A Survey,"  This work lists and describes the main recent strategies for building
fixed-length, dense and distributed representations for words, based on the
distributional hypothesis. These representations are now commonly called word
embeddings and, in addition to encoding surprisingly good syntactic and
semantic information, have been proven useful as extra features in many
downstream NLP tasks.
"
21941,The State of Sustainable Research Software: Results from the Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE5.1),"  This article summarizes motivations, organization, and activities of the
Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE5.1) held in Manchester, UK in September 2017. The WSSSPE series
promotes sustainable research software by positively impacting principles and
best practices, careers, learning, and credit. This article discusses the Code
of Conduct, idea papers, position papers, experience papers, demos, and
lightning talks presented during the workshop. The main part of the article
discusses the speed-blogging groups that formed during the meeting, along with
the outputs of those sessions.
"
21942,Complex Analysis of Real Functions III: Extended Fourier Theory,"  In the context of the complex-analytic structure within the unit disk
centered at the origin of the complex plane, that was presented in a previous
paper, we show that the complete Fourier theory of integrable real functions is
contained within that structure, that is, within the structure of the space of
inner analytic functions on the open unit disk. We then extend the Fourier
theory beyond the realm of integrable real functions, to include for example
singular Schwartz distributions, and possibly other objects.
"
21943,Topological density estimation,"  We introduce \emph{topological density estimation} (TDE), in which the
multimodal structure of a probability density function is topologically
inferred and subsequently used to perform bandwidth selection for kernel
density estimation. We show that TDE has performance and runtime advantages
over competing methods of kernel density estimation for highly multimodal
probability density functions. We also show that TDE yields useful auxiliary
information, that it can determine its own suitability for use, and we explain
its performance.
"
21944,From Bayesian Sparsity to Gated Recurrent Nets,"  The iterations of many first-order algorithms, when applied to minimizing
common regularized regression functions, often resemble neural network layers
with pre-specified weights. This observation has prompted the development of
learning-based approaches that purport to replace these iterations with
enhanced surrogates forged as DNN models from available training data. For
example, important NP-hard sparse estimation problems have recently benefitted
from this genre of upgrade, with simple feedforward or recurrent networks
ousting proximal gradient-based iterations. Analogously, this paper
demonstrates that more powerful Bayesian algorithms for promoting sparsity,
which rely on complex multi-loop majorization-minimization techniques, mirror
the structure of more sophisticated long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or
alternative gated feedback networks previously designed for sequence
prediction. As part of this development, we examine the parallels between
latent variable trajectories operating across multiple time-scales during
optimization, and the activations within deep network structures designed to
adaptively model such characteristic sequences. The resulting insights lead to
a novel sparse estimation system that, when granted training data, can estimate
optimal solutions efficiently in regimes where other algorithms fail, including
practical direction-of-arrival (DOA) and 3D geometry recovery problems. The
underlying principles we expose are also suggestive of a learning process for a
richer class of multi-loop algorithms in other domains.
"
21945,Unified estimation framework for unnormalized models with statistical efficiency,"  Parameter estimation of unnormalized models is a challenging problem because
normalizing constants are not calculated explicitly and maximum likelihood
estimation is computationally infeasible. Although some consistent estimators
have been proposed earlier, the problem of statistical efficiency does remain.
In this study, we propose a unified, statistically efficient estimation
framework for unnormalized models and several novel efficient estimators with
reasonable computational time regardless of whether the sample space is
discrete or continuous. The loss functions of the proposed estimators are
derived by combining the following two methods: (1) density-ratio matching
using Bregman divergence, and (2) plugging-in nonparametric estimators. We also
analyze the properties of the proposed estimators when the unnormalized model
is misspecified. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the advantages
of our method over existing approaches.
"
21946,Spectrally tunable linear polarization rotation using stacked metallic metamaterials,"  We theoretically study the transmission properties of a stack of metallic
metamaterials and show that is able to achieve a perfect transmission
selectively exhibiting broadband ($Q<10$) or extremely narrowband ($Q>10^5$)
polarization rotation. We especially highlight how the arrangement of the
stacked structure, as well as the metamaterial unit cell geometry, can highly
influence the transmission in the spectral domain. For this purpose, we use an
extended analytical Jones formalism that allows us to get a rigorous and
analytical expression of the transmission. Such versatile structures could find
potential applications in polarimetry or in the control of the light
polarization for THz waves.
"
21947,On the Computational Complexity of Variants of Combinatorial Voter Control in Elections,"  Voter control problems model situations in which an external agent tries
toaffect the result of an election by adding or deleting the fewest number of
voters. The goal of the agent is to make a specific candidate either win
(\emph{constructive} control) or lose (\emph{destructive} control) the
election. We study the constructive and destructive voter control problems
whenadding and deleting voters have a \emph{combinatorial flavor}: If we add
(resp.\ delete) a voter~$v$, we also add (resp.\ delete) a bundle~$\kappa(v) $
of voters that are associated with~$v$. While the bundle~$\kappa(v)$ may have
more than one voter, a voter may also be associated with more than one voter.
We analyze the computational complexity of the four voter control problems for
the Plurality rule. We obtain that, in general, making a candidate lose is
computationally easier than making her win. In particular, if the bundling
relation is symmetric (i.e.\ $\forall w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow v
\in \kappa(w) $), and if each voter has at most two voters associated with him,
then destructive control is polynomial-time solvable while the constructive
variant remains $\NP$-hard. Even if the bundles are disjoint (i.e.\ $\forall
w\colon w \in \kappa(v) \Leftrightarrow \kappa(v) = \kappa(w) $), the
constructive problem variants remain intractable. Finally, the minimization
variant of constructive control by adding voters does not admit an efficient
approximation algorithm, unless P=NP.
"
21948,Stochastic Submodular Maximization: The Case of Coverage Functions,"  Stochastic optimization of continuous objectives is at the heart of modern
machine learning. However, many important problems are of discrete nature and
often involve submodular objectives. We seek to unleash the power of stochastic
continuous optimization, namely stochastic gradient descent and its variants,
to such discrete problems. We first introduce the problem of stochastic
submodular optimization, where one needs to optimize a submodular objective
which is given as an expectation. Our model captures situations where the
discrete objective arises as an empirical risk (e.g., in the case of
exemplar-based clustering), or is given as an explicit stochastic model (e.g.,
in the case of influence maximization in social networks). By exploiting that
common extensions act linearly on the class of submodular functions, we employ
projected stochastic gradient ascent and its variants in the continuous domain,
and perform rounding to obtain discrete solutions. We focus on the rich and
widely used family of weighted coverage functions. We show that our approach
yields solutions that are guaranteed to match the optimal approximation
guarantees, while reducing the computational cost by several orders of
magnitude, as we demonstrate empirically.
"
21949,A non-singular theory of dislocations in anisotropic crystals,"  We develop a non-singular theory of three-dimensional dislocation loops in a
particular version of Mindlin's anisotropic gradient elasticity with up to six
length scale parameters. The theory is systematically developed as a
generalization of the classical anisotropic theory in the framework of
linearized incompatible elasticity. The non-singular version of all key
equations of anisotropic dislocation theory are derived as line integrals,
including the Burgers displacement equation with isolated solid angle, the
Peach-Koehler stress equation, the Mura-Willis equation for the elastic
distortion, and the Peach-Koehler force. The expression for the interaction
energy between two dislocation loops as a double line integral is obtained
directly, without the use of a stress function. It is shown that all the
elastic fields are non-singular, and that they converge to their classical
counterparts a few characteristic lengths away from the dislocation core. In
practice, the non-singular fields can be obtained from the classical ones by
replacing the classical (singular) anisotropic Green's tensor with the
non-singular anisotropic Green's tensor derived by \cite{Lazar:2015ja}. The
elastic solution is valid for arbitrary anisotropic media. In addition to the
classical anisotropic elastic constants, the non-singular Green's tensor
depends on a second order symmetric tensor of length scale parameters modeling
a weak non-locality, whose structure depends on the specific class of crystal
symmetry. The anisotropic Helmholtz operator defined by such tensor admits a
Green's function which is used as the spreading function for the Burgers vector
density. As a consequence, the Burgers vector density spreads differently in
different crystal structures.
"
21950,A Modularized Efficient Framework for Non-Markov Time Series Estimation,"  We present a compartmentalized approach to finding the maximum a-posteriori
(MAP) estimate of a latent time series that obeys a dynamic stochastic model
and is observed through noisy measurements. We specifically consider modern
signal processing problems with non-Markov signal dynamics (e.g. group
sparsity) and/or non-Gaussian measurement models (e.g. point process
observation models used in neuroscience). Through the use of auxiliary
variables in the MAP estimation problem, we show that a consensus formulation
of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enables iteratively
computing separate estimates based on the likelihood and prior and subsequently
""averaging"" them in an appropriate sense using a Kalman smoother. As such, this
can be applied to a broad class of problem settings and only requires modular
adjustments when interchanging various aspects of the statistical model. Under
broad log-concavity assumptions, we show that the separate estimation problems
are convex optimization problems and that the iterative algorithm converges to
the MAP estimate. As such, this framework can capture non-Markov latent time
series models and non-Gaussian measurement models. We provide example
applications involving (i) group-sparsity priors, within the context of
electrophysiologic specrotemporal estimation, and (ii) non-Gaussian measurement
models, within the context of dynamic analyses of learning with neural spiking
and behavioral observations.
"
21951,A holistic look at requirements engineering practices in the gaming industry,"  In this work we present an account of the status of requirements engineering
in the gaming industry. Recent papers in the area were surveyed.
Characterizations of the gaming industry were deliberated upon by portraying
its relations with the market industry. Some research directions in the area of
requirements engineering in the gaming industry were also mentioned.
"
21952,Hamilton paths with lasting separation,"  We determine the asymptotics of the largest cardinality of a set of Hamilton
paths in the complete graph with vertex set [n] under the condition that for
any two of the paths in the family there is a subpath of length k entirely
contained in only one of them and edge{disjoint from the other one.
"
21953,2D SLAM Quality Evaluation Methods,"  SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and mapping) is one of the most challenging
problems for mobile platforms and there is a huge amount of modern SLAM
algorithms. The choice of the algorithm that might be used in every particular
problem requires prior knowledge about advantages and disadvantages of each
algorithm. This paper presents the approach for comparison of SLAM algorithms
that allows to find the most accurate one. The accent of research is made on 2D
SLAM algorithms and the focus of analysis is 2D map that is built after
algorithm performance. Three metrics for evaluation of maps are presented in
this paper
"
21954,Communication: Two-structure thermodynamics unifying all scenarios for water anomalies,"  Anomalous behavior of water in superooled region (namely decrease of density
and sharp increase of response functions at atmospheric pressure) are manly
associated with either existence of liquid-liquid criticality or re-entering
vapor-liquid spinodal into positive pressure. Despite different origin both
scenarios introduce divergence of the response functions. We articulate in the
communication that the criticality is behind water anomalies, water has normal
vapor-liquid spinodal and that the re-entering feature was predicted because of
curved density surface as a consequence of existence of critical point. We can
proof this by new two structure equation of state with criticality resulting
from non-ideal mixing of two states and a background state being modeled by
exactly the same equation of state which was deployed for predicting of
vapor-liquid spinodal while formulating the re-entering scenario.
"
21955,The scattering problem for the $abcd$ Boussinesq system in the energy space,"  The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in
$\mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut
as first order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational,
two dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the
spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among many particular regimes,
depending each of them in terms of the value of the parameters $(a,b,c,d)$
present in the equations, the ""generic"" regime is characterized by the setting
$b,d>0$ and $a,c<0$. The system is hamiltonian if also $b=d$. The equations in
this regime are globally well-posed in the energy space $H^1\times H^1$,
provided one works with small solutions. In this paper, we investigate decay
and the scattering problem in this regime, which is characterized as having
(quadratic) long-range nonlinearities, very weak linear decay $O(t^{-1/3})$
because of the one dimensional setting, and existence of non scattering
solutions (solitary waves). We prove, among other results, that for a
sufficiently dispersive $abcd$ systems (characterized only in terms of
parameters $a, b$ and $c$), all small solutions must decay to zero, locally
strongly in the energy space, in proper subset of the light cone $|x|\leq |t|$.
We prove this result by constructing three suitable virial functionals in the
spirit of works by Kowalczyk, Martel and the second author, and more recently
by the last three authors (valid for the simpler scalar ""good Boussinesq""
model), leading to global in time decay and control of all local $H^1\times
H^1$ terms. No parity nor extra decay assumptions are needed to prove decay,
only small solutions in the energy space.
"
21956,Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new perspective,"  In this paper, we consider the problem of assessing local clustering in
complex networks. Various definitions for this measure have been proposed for
the cases of networks having weighted edges, but less attention has been paid
to both weighted and directed networks. We provide a new local clustering
coefficient for this kind of networks, starting from those existing in the
literature for the weighted and undirected case. Furthermore, we extract from
our coefficient four specific components, in order to separately consider
different link patterns of triangles. Empirical applications on several real
networks from different frameworks and with different order are provided. The
performance of our coefficient is also compared with that of existing
coefficients in the literature.
"
21957,Deep Learning Can Reverse Photon Migration for Diffuse Optical Tomography,"  Can artificial intelligence (AI) learn complicated non-linear physics? Here
we propose a novel deep learning approach that learns non-linear photon
scattering physics and obtains accurate 3D distribution of optical anomalies.
In contrast to the traditional black-box deep learning approaches to inverse
problems, our deep network learns to invert the Lippmann-Schwinger integral
equation which describes the essential physics of photon migration of diffuse
near-infrared (NIR) photons in turbid media. As an example for clinical
relevance, we applied the method to our prototype diffuse optical tomography
(DOT). We show that our deep neural network, trained with only simulation data,
can accurately recover the location of anomalies within biomimetic phantoms and
live animals without the use of an exogenous contrast agent.
"
21958,A new extended Cardioid model: an application to wind data,"  The Cardioid distribution is a relevant model for circular data. However,
this model is not suitable for scenarios were there is asymmetry or
multimodality. In order to overcome this gap, an extended Cardioid model is
proposed, which is called Exponentiated Cardioid (EC) distribution. Besides,
some of its properties are derived, such as trigonometric moments, kurtosis and
skewness. A discussion about the modality and and expressions for the quantiles
through approximations of the studied model are also presented. To fit the EC
model, two estimation methods are presented based on maximum likelihood and
quantile least squares procedures. The performance of proposed estimators is
evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation study, adopting both bias and mean square
error as comparison criteria. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a
dataset in the wind direction context. Results indicate that the EC
distribution may outperform Cardioid and the von Mises distributions.
"
21959,On the rank and the convergence rate towards the Sato-Tate measure,"  Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field and let $G$ denote
its Sato-Tate group. Under the assumption of certain standard conjectures on
$L$-functions attached to the irreducible representations of $G$, we study the
convergence rate of any virtual selfdual character of $G$. We find that this
convergence rate is dictated by several arithmetic invariants of $A$, such as
its rank or its Sato-Tate group $G$. The results are consonant with some
previous experimental observations, and we also provide additional numerical
evidence consistent with them. The techniques that we use were introduced by
Sarnak, in order to explain the bias in the sign of the Frobenius traces of an
elliptic curve without complex multiplication defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. We
show that the same methods can be adapted to study the convergence rate of the
characters of its Sato-Tate group, and that they can also be employed in the
more general case of abelian varieties over number fields. A key tool in our
analysis is the existence of limiting distributions for automorphic
$L$-functions, which is due to Akbary, Ng, and Shahabi.
"
21960,Adaptive Sampling for Convex Regression,"  In this paper, we introduce the first principled adaptive-sampling procedure
for learning a convex function in the $L_\infty$ norm, a problem that arises
often in the behavioral and social sciences. We present a function-specific
measure of complexity and use it to prove that, for each convex function
$f_{\star}$, our algorithm nearly attains the information-theoretically
optimal, function-specific error rate. We also corroborate our theoretical
contributions with numerical experiments, finding that our method substantially
outperforms passive, uniform sampling for favorable synthetic and data-derived
functions in low-noise settings with large sampling budgets. Our results also
suggest an idealized ""oracle strategy"", which we use to gauge the potential
advance of any adaptive-sampling strategy over passive sampling, for any given
convex function.
"
21961,Time Accuracy Analysis of Post-Mediation Packet-Switched Charging Data Records for Urban Mobility Applications,"  Telecommunication data is being used increasingly in urban mobility
applications around the world. Despite its ubiquity and usefulness, technical
difficulties arise when using Packet-Switched Charging Data Records (CDR),
since its main purpose was not intended for this kind of applications. Due to
its particular nature, a trade-off must be considered between accessibility and
time accuracy when using this data. On the one hand, to obtain highly accurate
timestamps, huge amounts of network-level CDR must be extracted and stored.
This task is very difficult and expensive since highly critical network node
applications can be compromised in the data extraction and storage. On the
other hand, post-mediation CDR can be easily accessed since no network node
application is involved in its analysis. The pay-off is in the lower accurate
timestamps recorded, since several aggregations and filtering is performed in
previous steps of the charging pipelines. In this work, a detailed description
of the timestamp error problem using post-mediation CDR is presented, together
with a methodology to analyze error time series collected in each network cell.
"
21962,Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimisation with Continuous Approximations,"  Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, are
used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and
experiment design. Recently, \emph{multi-fidelity} methods have garnered
considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly
expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations
to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process.
However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of
approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum
of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive
neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation
performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the
approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional
space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA,
for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it
achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations.
BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments.
"
21963,X-rays writing/reading of Charge Density Waves in the CuO2 plane of a simple cuprate superconductor,"  It is now well established that superconductivity in cuprates competes with
charge modulations giving electronic phase separation at a nanoscale. More
specifically, superconducting electronic current takes root in the available
free space left by electronic charge ordered domains, called charge density
wave (CDW) puddles. This means that CDW domain arrangement plays a fundamental
role in the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here
we report about the possibility of controlling the population and spatial
organization of the charge density wave puddles in a single crystal La2CuO4+y
through X - ray illumination and thermal treatments. We apply a pump - probe
method based on X - ray illumination as pump and X - ray diffraction as a probe
setting a writing and reading procedure of CDW puddles. Our findings are
expected to allow new routes for advanced design and manipulation of
superconducting pathways in new electronics.
"
21964,Alexandrov's theorem revisited,"  We show that among sets of finite perimeter balls are the only
volume-constrained critical points of the perimeter functional.
"
21965,Autonomous Multirobot Excavation for Lunar Applications,"  In this paper, a control approach called Artificial Neural Tissue (ANT) is
applied to multirobot excavation for lunar base preparation tasks including
clearing landing pads and burying of habitat modules. We show for the first
time, a team of autonomous robots excavating a terrain to match a given 3D
blueprint. Constructing mounds around landing pads will provide physical
shielding from debris during launch/landing. Burying a human habitat modules
under 0.5 m of lunar regolith is expected to provide both radiation shielding
and maintain temperatures of -25 $^{o}$C. This minimizes base life-support
complexity and reduces launch mass. ANT is compelling for a lunar mission
because it doesn't require a team of astronauts for excavation and it requires
minimal supervision. The robot teams are shown to autonomously interpret
blueprints, excavate and prepare sites for a lunar base. Because little
pre-programmed knowledge is provided, the controllers discover creative
techniques. ANT evolves techniques such as slot-dozing that would otherwise
require excavation experts. This is critical in making an excavation mission
feasible when it is prohibitively expensive to send astronauts. The controllers
evolve elaborate negotiation behaviors to work in close quarters. These and
other techniques such as concurrent evolution of the controller and team size
are shown to tackle problem of antagonism, when too many robots interfere
reducing the overall efficiency or worse, resulting in gridlock. While many
challenges remain with this technology our work shows a compelling pathway for
field testing this approach.
"
21966,Optimal Context Aware Transmission Strategy for non-Orthogonal D2D Communications,"  The increasing traffic demand in cellular networks has recently led to the
investigation of new strategies to save precious resources like spectrum and
energy. A possible solution employs direct device-to-device (D2D)
communications, which is particularly promising when the two terminals involved
in the communications are located in close proximity. The D2D communications
should coexist with other transmissions, so they must be careful scheduled in
order to avoid harmful interference impacts. In this paper, we analyze how a
distributed context-awareness, obtained by observing few local channel and
topology parameters, can be used to adaptively exploit D2D communications. We
develop a rigorous theoretical analysis to quantify the balance between the
gain offered by a D2D transmission, and its impact on the other network
communications. Based on this analysis, we derive two theorems that define the
optimal strategy to be employed, in terms of throughput maximization, when a
single or multiple transmit power levels are available for the D2D
communications. We compare this strategy to the state-of-the-art in the same
network scenario, showing how context awareness can be exploited to achieve a
higher sum throughput and an improved fairness.
"
21967,Giant-spin nonlinear response theory of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia: a field dependence study,"  Understanding high-field amplitude electromagnetic heat loss phenomena is of
great importance, in particular in the biomedical field, since the
heat-delivery treatment plans might rely on analytical models that are only
valid at low field amplitudes. Here, we develop a nonlinear response model
valid for single- domain nanoparticles of larger particle sizes and higher
field amplitudes in comparison to linear response theory. A nonlinear
magnetization expression and a generalized heat loss power equation are
obtained and compared with the exact solution of the stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation assuming the giant-spin hypothesis. The model
is valid within the hyperthermia therapeutic window and predicts a shift of
optimum particle size and distinct heat loss field amplitude exponents.
Experimental hyperthermia data with distinct ferrite-based nanoparticles, as
well as third harmonic magnetization data supports the nonlinear model, which
also has implications for magnetic particle imaging and magnetic thermometry.
"
21968,Anisotropy crossover in the frustrated Hubbard model on four-chain cylinders,"  Motivated by dimensional crossover in layered organic ${\kappa}$ salts, we
determine the phase diagram of a system of four periodically coupled Hubbard
chains with frustration at half filling as a function of the interchain hopping
${t_{\perp}/t}$ and interaction strength ${U/t}$ at a fixed ratio of
frustration and interchain hopping ${t'/t_{\perp}=-0.5}$. We cover the range
from the one-dimensional limit of uncoupled chains (${t_{\perp}/t=0.0}$) to the
isotropic model (${t_{\perp}/t=1.0}$). For strong ${U/t}$, we find an
antiferromagnetic insulator; in the weak-to-moderate-interaction regime, the
phase diagram features quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnetic behavior, an
incommensurate spin-density wave, and a metallic phase as ${t_{\perp}/t}$ is
increased. We characterize the phases through their magnetic ordering,
dielectric response, and dominant static correlations. Our analysis is based
primarily on a variant of the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm
based on an efficient hybrid-real-momentum-space formulation, in which we can
treat relatively large lattices albeit of a limited width. This is complemented
by a variational cluster approximation study with a cluster geometry
corresponding to the cylindrical lattice allowing us to directly compare the
two methods for this geometry. As an outlook, we make contact with work
studying dimensional crossover in the full two-dimensional system.
"
21969,On the concavity of a sum of elementary symmetric polynomials,"  We introduce a new problem on the elementary symmetric polynomials
$\sigma_k$, stemming from the constraint equations of some modified gravity
theory. For which coefficients is a linear combination of $\sigma_k$
$1/p$-concave, with $0 \leq k \leq p$? We establish connections between the
$1/p$-concavity and the real-rootedness of some polynomials built on the
coefficients. We conjecture that if the restriction of the linear combination
to the positive diagonal is a real-rooted polynomial, then the linear
combination is $1/p$-concave. Using the theory of hyperbolic polynomials, we
show that this would be implied by a short algebraic statement: if the
polynomials $P$ and $Q$ of degree $n$ are real-rooted, then $\sum_{k=0}^n
P^{(k)}Q^{(n-k)}$ is real-rooted as well. This is not proven yet. We conjecture
more generally that the global $1/p$-concavity is equivalent to the
$1/p$-concavity on the positive diagonal. We prove all our guessings for $p=2$.
The way is open for further developments.
"
21970,MIT Autonomous Vehicle Technology Study: Large-Scale Deep Learning Based Analysis of Driver Behavior and Interaction with Automation,"  For the foreseeble future, human beings will likely remain an integral part
of the driving task, monitoring the AI system as it performs anywhere from just
over 0% to just under 100% of the driving. The governing objectives of the MIT
Autonomous Vehicle Technology (MIT-AVT) study are to (1) undertake large-scale
real-world driving data collection that includes high-definition video to fuel
the development of deep learning based internal and external perception
systems, (2) gain a holistic understanding of how human beings interact with
vehicle automation technology by integrating video data with vehicle state
data, driver characteristics, mental models, and self-reported experiences with
technology, and (3) identify how technology and other factors related to
automation adoption and use can be improved in ways that save lives. In
pursuing these objectives, we have instrumented 21 Tesla Model S and Model X
vehicles, 2 Volvo S90 vehicles, 2 Range Rover Evoque, and 2 Cadillac CT6
vehicles for both long-term (over a year per driver) and medium term (one month
per driver) naturalistic driving data collection. Furthermore, we are
continually developing new methods for analysis of the massive-scale dataset
collected from the instrumented vehicle fleet. The recorded data streams
include IMU, GPS, CAN messages, and high-definition video streams of the driver
face, the driver cabin, the forward roadway, and the instrument cluster (on
select vehicles). The study is on-going and growing. To date, we have 99
participants, 11,846 days of participation, 405,807 miles, and 5.5 billion
video frames. This paper presents the design of the study, the data collection
hardware, the processing of the data, and the computer vision algorithms
currently being used to extract actionable knowledge from the data.
"
21971,Propagation estimates in the one-commutator theory,"  In the abstract framework of Mourre theory, the propagation of states is
understood in terms of a conjugate operator $A$. A powerful estimate has long
been known for Hamiltonians having a good regularity with respect to $A$ thanks
to the limiting absorption principle (LAP). We study the case where $H$ has
less regularity with respect to $A$, specifically in a situation where the LAP
and the absence of singularly continuous spectrum have not yet been
established. We show that in this case the spectral measure of $H$ is a
Rajchman measure and we derive some propagation estimates. One estimate is an
application of minimal escape velocities, while the other estimate relies on an
improved version of the RAGE formula. Based on several examples, including
continuous and discrete Schrödinger operators, it appears that the latter
propagation estimate is a new result for multi-dimensional Hamiltonians.
