20973,Closed-form Marginal Likelihood in Gamma-Poisson Matrix Factorization,"  We present novel understandings of the Gamma-Poisson (GaP) model, a
probabilistic matrix factorization model for count data. We show that GaP can
be rewritten free of the score/activation matrix. This gives us new insights
about the estimation of the topic/dictionary matrix by maximum marginal
likelihood estimation. In particular, this explains the robustness of this
estimator to over-specified values of the factorization rank, especially its
ability to automatically prune irrelevant dictionary columns, as empirically
observed in previous work. The marginalization of the activation matrix leads
in turn to a new Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm with favorable
properties.

20974,Laboratory mid-IR spectra of equilibrated and igneous meteorites. Searching for observables of planetesimal debris,"  Meteorites contain minerals from Solar System asteroids with different
properties (like size, presence of water, core formation). We provide new
mid-IR transmission spectra of powdered meteorites to obtain templates of how
mid-IR spectra of asteroidal debris would look like. This is essential for
interpreting mid-IR spectra of past and future space observatories, like the
James Webb Space Telescope. We show that the transmission spectra of wet and
dry chondrites, carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites and achondrite and
chondrite meteorites are distinctly different in a way one can distinguish in
astronomical mid-IR spectra. The two observables that spectroscopically
separate the different meteorites groups (and thus the different types of
parent bodies) are the pyroxene-olivine feature strength ratio and the peak
shift of the olivine spectral features due to an increase in the iron
concentration of the olivine.

20975,Case For Static AMSDU Aggregation in WLANs,"  Frame aggregation is a mechanism by which multiple frames are combined into a
single transmission unit over the air. Frames aggregated at the AMSDU level use
a common CRC check to enforce integrity. For longer aggregated AMSDU frames,
the packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate.
Hence, multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based
on the error rate. This study evaluates if there is a \emph{practical}
advantage in doing adaptive AMSDU aggregation based on the link bit error rate.
Evaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive
AMSDU frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation
aspects, it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional
mechanisms while keeping the AMSDU aggregation logic simple.

20976,The $Gaia$-ESO Survey: the inner disk intermediate-age open cluster NGC 6802,"  Milky Way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age, chemical
composition, and kinematic properties. Intermediate-age and old open clusters
are less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar
Galactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction
inside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)
observed by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target
for calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and
chemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements
from $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence
dwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as
cluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a
median radial velocity of $13.6\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster
members have a median radial velocity of $12.0\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median
[Fe/H] of $0.10\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster
members suggests an age of $0.9\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and
$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC
6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about
IOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs
previously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and
Berkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.
These elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of
cluster turn-off mass. The $\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements
are also explored in a self-consistent way.

20977,Witness-Functions versus Interpretation-Functions for Secrecy in Cryptographic Protocols: What to Choose?,"  Proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task.
One of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is
increasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message
exchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases. Recently, two
families of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of
atomic messages. The first one is the family of interpretation-functions. The
second is the family of witness-functions. In this paper, we show that the
witness-functions are more efficient than interpretation-functions. We give a
detailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed
in proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail
to do so.

20978,Pairwise Difference Estimation of High Dimensional Partially Linear Model,"  This paper proposes a regularized pairwise difference approach for estimating
the linear component coefficient in a partially linear model, with consistency
and exact rates of convergence obtained in high dimensions under mild scaling
requirements. Our analysis reveals interesting features such as (i) the
bandwidth parameter automatically adapts to the model and is actually
tuning-insensitive; and (ii) the procedure could even maintain fast rate of
convergence for $\alpha$-HÃ¶lder class of $\alpha\leq1/2$. Simulation studies
show the advantage of the proposed method, and application of our approach to a
brain imaging data reveals some biological patterns which fail to be recovered
using competing methods.

20979,Dissecting the multivariate extremal index and tail dependence,"  A central issue in the theory of extreme values focuses on suitable
conditions such that the well-known results for the limiting distributions of
the maximum of i.i.d. sequences can be applied to stationary ones. In this
context, the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of
temporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. The
multivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to
a multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the
marginal sequences and between them. As it is a function, the inference becomes
more difficult, and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations,
namely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate. In
this work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of
information contained in the multivariate extremal index, an upper limit better
than those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the
limiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence. We will
illustrate the results with examples of recognized interest in applications.

20980,"Big Universe, Big Data: Machine Learning and Image Analysis for Astronomy","  Astrophysics and cosmology are rich with data. The advent of wide-area
digital cameras on large aperture telescopes has led to ever more ambitious
surveys of the sky. Data volumes of entire surveys a decade ago can now be
acquired in a single night and real-time analysis is often desired. Thus,
modern astronomy requires big data know-how, in particular it demands highly
efficient machine learning and image analysis algorithms. But scalability is
not the only challenge: Astronomy applications touch several current machine
learning research questions, such as learning from biased data and dealing with
label and measurement noise. We argue that this makes astronomy a great domain
for computer science research, as it pushes the boundaries of data analysis. In
the following, we will present this exciting application area for data
scientists. We will focus on exemplary results, discuss main challenges, and
highlight some recent methodological advancements in machine learning and image
analysis triggered by astronomical applications.

20981,Natural Language Does Not Emerge 'Naturally' in Multi-Agent Dialog,"  A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of
communication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations, and have
simultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in
the protocols developed by the agents, all learned without any human
supervision!
In this paper, using a Task and Tell reference game between two agents as a
testbed, we present a sequence of 'negative' results culminating in a
'positive' one -- showing that while most agent-invented languages are
effective (i.e. achieve near-perfect task rewards), they are decidedly not
interpretable or compositional.
In essence, we find that natural language does not emerge 'naturally',
despite the semblance of ease of natural-language-emergence that one may gather
from recent literature. We discuss how it is possible to coax the invented
languages to become more and more human-like and compositional by increasing
restrictions on how two agents may communicate.

20982,Properties and Origin of Galaxy Velocity Bias in the Illustris Simulation,"  We use the hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the Illustris
suite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias, i.e., the
difference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter
inside halos. We find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the
ratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass. In general, central galaxies
are not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos, with a
velocity dispersion above 0.04 times that of the dark matter. The central
galaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions
between the central and satellite galaxies. For satellite galaxies, the
velocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after
being accreted onto the host halos. It depends on the time after the accretion
and their distances from the halo centers, with massive satellites generally
moving more slowly than the dark matter. The results are in broad agreements
with those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering
data, and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy
clustering.

20983,Computer Modeling of Halogen Bonds and Other $Ï$-Hole Interactions,"  In the field of noncovalent interactions a new paradigm has recently become
popular. It stems from the analysis of molecular electrostatic potentials and
introduces a label, which has recently attracted enormous attention. The label
is {\sigma}-hole, and it was first used in connection with halogens. It
initiated a renaissance of interest in halogenated compounds, and later on,
when found also on other groups of atoms (chalcogens, pnicogens, tetrels and
aerogens), it resulted in a new direction of research of intermolecular
interactions. In this review, we summarize advances from about the last 10
years in understanding those interactions related to {\sigma}-hole. We pay
particular attention to theoretical and computational techniques, which play a
crucial role in the field.

20984,Towards Universal End-to-End Affect Recognition from Multilingual Speech by ConvNets,"  We propose an end-to-end affect recognition approach using a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) that handles multiple languages, with applications to
emotion and personality recognition from speech. We lay the foundation of a
universal model that is trained on multiple languages at once. As affect is
shared across all languages, we are able to leverage shared information between
languages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an
average improvement of 12.8% on emotion and 10.1% on personality when compared
with the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we
directly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as
input audio recorded from any source and to avoid the overhead and information
loss of feature extraction. It outperforms a similar CNN using spectrograms as
input by 12.8% for emotion and 6.3% for personality, based on F-scores.
Analysis of the network parameters and layers activation shows that the network
learns and extracts significant features in the first layer, in particular
pitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead
capture language-specific representations through the analysis of
supra-segmental features. Our model represents an important step for the
development of a fully universal affect recognizer, able to recognize
additional descriptors, such as stress, and for the future implementation into
affective interactive systems.

20985,A Variational Characterization of Fluid Sloshing with Surface Tension,"  We consider the sloshing problem for an incompressible, inviscid,
irrotational fluid in an open container, including effects due to surface
tension on the free surface. We restrict ourselves to a constant contact angle
and seek time-harmonic solutions of the linearized problem, which describes the
time-evolution of the fluid due to a small initial disturbance of the surface
at rest. As opposed to the zero surface tension case, where the problem reduces
to a partial differential equation for the velocity potential, we obtain a
coupled system for the velocity potential and the free surface displacement. We
derive a new variational formulation of the coupled problem and establish the
existence of solutions using the direct method from the calculus of variations.
We prove a domain monotonicity result for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue.
In the limit of zero surface tension, we recover the variational formulation of
the mixed Steklov-Neumann eigenvalue problem and give the first-order
perturbation formula for a simple eigenvalue.

20987,Statistical Inference in Political Networks Research,"  Researchers interested in statistically modeling network data have a
well-established and quickly growing set of approaches from which to choose.
Several of these methods have been regularly applied in research on political
networks, while others have yet to permeate the field. Here, we review the most
prominent methods of inferential network analysis---both for cross-sectionally
and longitudinally observed networks including (temporal) exponential random
graph models, latent space models, the quadratic assignment procedure, and
stochastic actor oriented models. For each method, we summarize its analytic
form, identify prominent published applications in political science and
discuss computational considerations. We conclude with a set of guidelines for
selecting a method for a given application.

20988,Controller-jammer game models of Denial of Service in control systems operating over packet-dropping links,"  The paper introduces a class of zero-sum games between the adversary and
controller as a scenario for a `denial of service' in a networked control
system. The communication link is modeled as a set of transmission regimes
controlled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the
plant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate
that even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point
equilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region
of the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a
nontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard
stochastic control problem over a packet dropping link. The paper derives
conditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium.
Furthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions
provide `greedy' jamming strategies for the adversary.

20989,Conservation of spin supercurrents in superconductors,"  We demonstrate that spin supercurrents are conserved upon transmission
through a conventional superconductor, even in the presence of spin-dependent
scattering by impurities with magnetic moments or spin-orbit coupling. This is
fundamentally different from conventional spin currents, which decay in the
presence of such scattering, and this has important implications for the usage
of superconducting materials in spintronic hybrid structures.

20990,Driver Identification Using Automobile Sensor Data from a Single Turn,"  As automotive electronics continue to advance, cars are becoming more and
more reliant on sensors to perform everyday driving operations. These sensors
are omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide
comfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers
themselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data
collected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of
individuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where
our dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by
multiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each
individual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short
road segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI
AG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped
with automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show
that turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across
drivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12
most frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway
on-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning
useful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.

20991,Same-different problems strain convolutional neural networks,"  The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a
hallmark of biological vision. We argue that, despite recent progress in visual
recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their
ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes
impossible, as when intra-class variability exceeds network capacity. Motivated
by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback
mechanisms including attention and perceptual grouping may be the key
computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\

20992,Hyper-dimensional computing for a visual question-answering system that is trainable end-to-end,"  In this work we propose a system for visual question answering. Our
architecture is composed of two parts, the first part creates the logical
knowledge base given the image. The second part evaluates questions against the
knowledge base. Differently from previous work, the knowledge base is
represented using hyper-dimensional computing. This choice has the advantage
that all the operations in the system, namely creating the knowledge base and
evaluating the questions against it, are differentiable, thereby making the
system easily trainable in an end-to-end fashion.

20993,The Inner Structure of Time-Dependent Signals,"  This paper shows how a time series of measurements of an evolving system can
be processed to create an inner time series that is unaffected by any
instantaneous invertible, possibly nonlinear transformation of the
measurements. An inner time series contains information that does not depend on
the nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.
Instead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the
observed system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may
produce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence
of sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of
non-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it
consists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series
of an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be
used to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without
using blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.
The method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the
audio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4)
mixtures of audio waveforms of two speakers.

20994,Classical properties of the leading eigenstates of quantum dissipative systems,"  By analyzing a paradigmatic example of the theory of dissipative systems --
the classical and quantum dissipative standard map -- we are able to explain
the main features of the decay to the quantum equilibrium state. The classical
isoperiodic stable structures typically present in the parameter space of these
kind of systems play a fundamental role. In fact, we have found that the period
of stable structures that are near in this space determines the phase of the
leading eigenstates of the corresponding quantum superoperator. Moreover, the
eigenvectors show a strong localization on the corresponding periodic orbits
(limit cycles). We show that this sort of scarring phenomenon (an established
property of Hamiltonian and projectively open systems) is present in the
dissipative case and it is of extreme simplicity.

20995,Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training,"  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent
structures in sequence modeling. It aims to use gates to control information
flow (e.g., whether to skip some information or not) in the recurrent
computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only
partially achieves this goal. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM
training, which pushes the output values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing
so, we can better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or
closed, instead of in a middle state, which makes the results more
interpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems that we
restrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better or
comparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The
outputs of gates are not sensitive to their inputs: we can easily compress the
LSTM unit in multiple ways, e.g., low-rank approximation and low-precision
approximation. The compressed models are even better than the baseline models
without compression.

20996,GUB Covers and Power-Indexed formulations for Wireless Network Design,"  We propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design problem,
i.e. the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service
coverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with classical mixed integer
formulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we
consider only a finite set of powers values. This has two major advantages: it
better fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems
which heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is
an effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the
coverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the GUB cover
inequalities introduced by Wolsey (1990) and its core is an extension of the
exact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints. This
special case corresponds to the very common practical situation where only one
major interferer is present. We assess the effectiveness of our formulation by
comprehensive computational results over realistic instances of two typical
technologies, namely WiMAX and DVB-T.

20997,Orbital contributions to the electron g-factor in semiconductor nanowires,"  Recent experiments on Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires [Albrecht
et al., Nat. 531, 206 (2016)] revealed a surprisingly large electronic LandÃ©
g-factor, several times larger than the bulk value - contrary to the
expectation that confinement reduces the g-factor. Here we assess the role of
orbital contributions to the electron g-factor in nanowires and quantum dots.
We show that an LS coupling in higher subbands leads to an enhancement of the
g-factor of an order of magnitude or more for small effective mass
semiconductors. We validate our theoretical finding with simulations of InAs
and InSb, showing that the effect persists even if cylindrical symmetry is
broken. A huge anisotropy of the enhanced g-factors under magnetic field
rotation allows for a straightforward experimental test of this theory.

20998,Comprehensive routing strategy on multilayer networks,"  Designing an efficient routing strategy is of great importance to alleviate
traffic congestion in multilayer networks. In this work, we design an effective
routing strategy for multilayer networks by comprehensively considering the
roles of nodes' local structures in micro-level, as well as the macro-level
differences in transmission speeds between different layers. Both numerical and
analytical results indicate that our proposed routing strategy can reasonably
redistribute the traffic load of the low speed layer to the high speed layer,
and thus the traffic capacity of multilayer networks are significantly enhanced
compared with the monolayer low speed networks. There is an optimal combination
of macro- and micro-level control parameters at which can remarkably alleviate
the congestion and thus maximize the traffic capacity for a given multilayer
network. Moreover, we find that increasing the size and the average degree of
the high speed layer can enhance the traffic capacity of multilayer networks
more effectively. We finally verify that real-world network topology does not
invalidate the results. The theoretical predictions agree well with the
numerical simulations.

20999,Long short-term memory and learning-to-learn in networks of spiking neurons,"  Recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) underlie the astounding
computing and learning capabilities of the brain. But computing and learning
capabilities of RSNN models have remained poor, at least in comparison with
artificial neural networks (ANNs). We address two possible reasons for that.
One is that RSNNs in the brain are not randomly connected or designed according
to simple rules, and they do not start learning as a tabula rasa network.
Rather, RSNNs in the brain were optimized for their tasks through evolution,
development, and prior experience. Details of these optimization processes are
largely unknown. But their functional contribution can be approximated through
powerful optimization methods, such as backpropagation through time (BPTT).
A second major mismatch between RSNNs in the brain and models is that the
latter only show a small fraction of the dynamics of neurons and synapses in
the brain. We include neurons in our RSNN model that reproduce one prominent
dynamical process of biological neurons that takes place at the behaviourally
relevant time scale of seconds: neuronal adaptation. We denote these networks
as LSNNs because of their Long short-term memory. The inclusion of adapting
neurons drastically increases the computing and learning capability of RSNNs if
they are trained and configured by deep learning (BPTT combined with a rewiring
algorithm that optimizes the network architecture). In fact, the computational
performance of these RSNNs approaches for the first time that of LSTM networks.
In addition RSNNs with adapting neurons can acquire abstract knowledge from
prior learning in a Learning-to-Learn (L2L) scheme, and transfer that knowledge
in order to learn new but related tasks from very few examples. We demonstrate
this for supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

observed below 3 THz (~100 cm-1), for a low-symmetry Zr-based metal-organic
framework (MOF) structure, termed MIL-140A [ZrO(O2C-C6H4-CO2)]. Utilizing a
combination of high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and synchrotron
radiation far-infrared spectroscopy, we measured low-energy vibrations
originating from the hindered rotations of organic linkers, whose energy
barriers and detailed dynamics have been elucidated via ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. For completeness, we obtained Raman
spectra and characterized the alterations to the complex pore architecture
caused by the THz rotations. We discovered an array of soft modes with
trampoline-like motions, which could potentially be the source of anomalous
mechanical phenomena, such as negative linear compressibility and negative
thermal expansion. Our results also demonstrate coordinated shear dynamics
(~2.5 THz), a mechanism which we have shown to destabilize MOF crystals, in the
exact crystallographic direction of the minimum shear modulus (Gmin).

21001,A southern-sky total intensity source catalogue at 2.3 GHz from S-band Polarisation All-Sky Survey data,"  The S-band Polarisation All-Sky Survey (S-PASS) has observed the entire
southern sky using the 64-metre Parkes radio telescope at 2.3GHz with an
effective bandwidth of 184MHz. The surveyed sky area covers all declinations
$\delta\leq 0^\circ$. To analyse compact sources the survey data have been
re-processed to produce a set of 107 Stokes $I$ maps with 10.75arcmin
resolution and the large scale emission contribution filtered out. In this
paper we use these Stokes $I$ images to create a total intensity southern-sky
extragalactic source catalogue at 2.3GHz. The source catalogue contains 23,389
sources and covers a sky area of 16,600deg$^2$, excluding the Galactic plane
for latitudes $|b|<10^\circ$. Approximately 8% of catalogued sources are
resolved. S-PASS source positions are typically accurate to within 35arcsec. At
a flux density of 225mJy the S-PASS source catalogue is more than 95% complete,

21002,Mechanomyography based closed-loop Functional Electrical Stimulation cycling system,"  Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems are successful in restoring
motor function and supporting paralyzed users. Commercially available FES
products are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing
conditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and
poor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop
between stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive
stimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to
monitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography
(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel
mechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during
stimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling
rig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and
stimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the
pedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a
magnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a
potentiometer. We illustrated this with a closed-loop stimulation algorithm
that used the inputs from the sensors to control the output of a programmable
RehaStim 1 FES stimulator (Hasomed) in real-time. This recumbent bicycle rig
was used as a testing platform for FES cycling. The algorithm was designed to
respond to a change in requested speed (RPM) from the user and change the
stimulation power (% of maximum current mA) until this speed was achieved and
then maintain it.

21003,QT2S: A System for Monitoring Road Traffic via Fine Grounding of Tweets,"  Social media platforms provide continuous access to user generated content
that enables real-time monitoring of user behavior and of events. The
geographical dimension of such user behavior and events has recently caught a
lot of attention in several domains: mobility, humanitarian, or
infrastructural. While resolving the location of a user can be straightforward,
depending on the affordances of their device and/or of the application they are
using, in most cases, locating a user demands a larger effort, such as
exploiting textual features. On Twitter for instance, only 2% of all tweets are
geo-referenced. In this paper, we present a system for zoomed-in grounding
(below city level) for short messages (e.g., tweets). The system combines
different natural language processing and machine learning techniques to
increase the number of geo-grounded tweets, which is essential to many
applications such as disaster response and real-time traffic monitoring.

21004,A Benchmark for Dose Finding Studies with Continuous Outcomes,"  An important tool to evaluate the performance of any design is an optimal
benchmark proposed by O'Quigley and others (2002, Biostatistics 3(1), 51-56)
that provides an upper bound on the performance of a design under a given
scenario. The original benchmark can be applied to dose finding studies with a
binary endpoint only. However, there is a growing interest in dose finding
studies involving continuous outcomes, but no benchmark for such studies has
been developed. We show that the original benchmark and its extension by Cheung
(2014, Biometrics 70(2), 389-397), when looked at from a different perspective,
can be generalised to various settings with several discrete and continuous
outcomes. We illustrate and compare the benchmark performance in the setting of
a Phase I clinical trial with continuous toxicity endpoint and in the setting
of a Phase I/II clinical trial with continuous efficacy outcome. We show that
the proposed benchmark provides an accurate upper bound for model-based dose
finding methods and serves as a powerful tool for evaluating designs.

in the uplink due to the exclusivity in resource allocation. This issue is more
prominent when fairness among the users is considered in the system. Current
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques introduce redundancy by
coding/spreading to facilitate the users' signals separation at the receiver,
which degrade the system spectral efficiency. Hence, in order to achieve higher
capacity, more efficient NOMA schemes need to be developed. In this paper, we
propose a NOMA scheme for uplink that removes the resource allocation
exclusivity and allows more than one user to share the same subcarrier without
any coding/spreading redundancy. Joint processing is implemented at the
receiver to detect the users' signals. However, to control the receiver
complexity, an upper limit on the number of users per subcarrier needs to be
imposed. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is
proposed for the new NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' sum-rate. The
link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed scheme achieves
bit error rate close to the single-user case. Numerical results show that the
proposed NOMA scheme can significantly improve the system performance in terms
of spectral efficiency and fairness comparing to OFDMA.

important quantitative properties that one would expect from a random sample
with respect to an underlying geometric configuration.

21008,A continuous framework for fairness,"  Increasingly, discrimination by algorithms is perceived as a societal and
legal problem. As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic
fairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper
proposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\theta$) which enables a
continuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More
specifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.
First, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between
concepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the algorithm
enables the decision maker to adopt intermediate ""worldviews"" on the degree of
discrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to the extreme
cases of ""we're all equal"" (WAE) and ""what you see is what you get"" (WYSIWYG)
proposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal transport theory, and
specifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize decision maker utility
under the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the algorithm is able to handle
cases of intersectionality, i.e., of multi-dimensional discrimination of
certain groups on grounds of several criteria. We discuss three main examples
(college admissions; credit application; insurance contracts) and map out the
policy implications of our approach. The explicit formalization of the
trade-off between individual and group fairness allows this post-processing
approach to be tailored to different situational contexts in which one or the
other fairness criterion may take precedence.

expansion of the non-negative integers. More precisely, we consider the
sequence $(S_b(n))_{n\ge 0}$ counting the number of positive entries on each
row of a generalization of the Pascal triangle to binomial coefficients of
base-$b$ expansions. By using a convenient tree structure, we provide
recurrence relations for $(S_b(n))_{n\ge 0}$ leading to the $b$-regularity of
the latter sequence. Then we deduce the asymptotics of the summatory function
of the sequence $(S_b(n))_{n\ge 0}$.

21010,Tensor Renormalization Group with Randomized Singular Value Decomposition,"  An algorithm of the tensor renormalization group is proposed based on a
randomized algorithm for singular value decomposition. Our algorithm is
applicable to a broad range of two-dimensional classical models. In the case of
a square lattice, its computational complexity and memory usage are
proportional to the fifth and the third power of the bond dimension,
respectively, whereas those of the conventional implementation are of the sixth
and the fourth power. The oversampling parameter larger than the bond dimension
is sufficient to reproduce the same result as full singular value decomposition
even at the critical point of the two-dimensional Ising model.

21011,Cohomology of symplectic groups and Meyer's signature theorem,"  Meyer showed that the signature of a closed oriented surface bundle over a
surface is a multiple of $4$, and can be computed using an element of
$H^2(\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z})$. Denoting by $1 \to \mathbb{Z}
\to \widetilde{\mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})} \to \mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z}) \to
1$ the pullback of the universal cover of $\mathsf{ Sp}(2g,\mathbb{R})$,
Deligne proved that every finite index subgroup of $\widetilde{\mathsf {Sp}(2g,
\mathbb{Z})}$ contains $2\mathbb{Z}$. As a consequence, a class in the second
cohomology of any finite quotient of $\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z})$ can at most
enable us to compute the signature of a surface bundle modulo $8$. We show that
this is in fact possible and investigate the smallest quotient of
$\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z})$ that contains this information. This quotient
$\mathfrak{H}$ is a non-split extension of $\mathsf {Sp}(2g,2)$ by an
elementary abelian group of order $2^{2g+1}$. There is a central extension
$1\to \mathbb{Z}/2\to\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}\to\mathfrak{H}\to 1$, and
$\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ appears as a quotient of the metaplectic double cover
$\mathsf{Mp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})=\widetilde{\mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
It is an extension of $\mathsf{Sp}(2g,2)$ by an almost extraspecial group of
order $2^{2g+2}$, and has a faithful irreducible complex representation of
dimension $2^g$. Provided $g\ge 4$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ is the universal
central extension of $\mathfrak{H}$. Putting all this together, we provide a
recipe for computing the signature modulo $8$, and indicate some consequences.

21013,randUTV: A blocked randomized algorithm for computing a rank-revealing UTV factorization,"  This manuscript describes the randomized algorithm randUTV for computing a so
called UTV factorization efficiently. Given a matrix $A$, the algorithm
computes a factorization $A = UTV^{*}$, where $U$ and $V$ have orthonormal
columns, and $T$ is triangular (either upper or lower, whichever is preferred).
The algorithm randUTV is developed primarily to be a fast and easily
parallelized alternative to algorithms for computing the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD). randUTV provides accuracy very close to that of the SVD
for problems such as low-rank approximation, solving ill-conditioned linear
systems, determining bases for various subspaces associated with the matrix,
etc. Moreover, randUTV produces highly accurate approximations to the singular
values of $A$. Unlike the SVD, the randomized algorithm proposed builds a UTV
factorization in an incremental, single-stage, and non-iterative way, making it
possible to halt the factorization process once a specified tolerance has been
met. Numerical experiments comparing the accuracy and speed of randUTV to the
SVD are presented. These experiments demonstrate that in comparison to column
pivoted QR, which is another factorization that is often used as a relatively
economic alternative to the SVD, randUTV compares favorably in terms of speed
while providing far higher accuracy.

21015,Modeling WiFi Traffic for White Space Prediction in Wireless Sensor Networks,"  Cross Technology Interference (CTI) is a prevalent phenomenon in the 2.4 GHz
unlicensed spectrum causing packet losses and increased channel contention. In
particular, WiFi interference is a severe problem for low-power wireless
networks as its presence causes a significant degradation of the overall
performance. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach based on WiFi
interference modeling for accurately predicting transmission opportunities for
low-power wireless networks. We leverage statistical analysis of real-world
WiFi traces to learn aggregated traffic characteristics in terms of
Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) that, once captured into a specific 2nd order Markov
Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP(2)) model, enable accurate estimation of
interference. We further use a hidden Markov model (HMM) for channel occupancy

21016,Dyson models under renormalization and in weak fields,"  We consider one-dimensional long-range spin models (usually called Dyson
models), consisting of Ising ferromagnets with slowly decaying long-range pair
potentials of the form $\frac{1}{|i-j|^{\alpha}}$ mainly focusing on the range
of slow decays $1 < \alpha \leq 2$. We describe two recent results, one about
renormalization and one about the effect of external fields at low temperature.
The first result states that a decimated long-range Gibbs measure in one
dimension becomes non-Gibbsian, in the same vein as comparable results in
higher dimensions for short-range models. The second result addresses the
behaviour of such models under inhomogeneous fields, in particular external
fields which decay to zero polynomially as $(|i|+1)^{- \gamma}$. We study how
the critical decay power of the field, $\gamma$, for which the phase transition
persists and the decay power $\alpha$ of the Dyson model compare, extending
recent results for short-range models on lattices and on trees. We also briefly
point out some analogies between these results.

21017,Coupling geometry on binary bipartite networks: hypotheses testing on pattern geometry and nestedness,"  Upon a matrix representation of a binary bipartite network, via the
permutation invariance, a coupling geometry is computed to approximate the
minimum energy macrostate of a network's system. Such a macrostate is supposed
to constitute the intrinsic structures of the system, so that the coupling
geometry should be taken as information contents, or even the nonparametric
minimum sufficient statistics of the network data. Then pertinent null and
alternative hypotheses, such as nestedness, are to be formulated according to
the macrostate. That is, any efficient testing statistic needs to be a function
of this coupling geometry. These conceptual architectures and mechanisms are by
and large still missing in community ecology literature, and rendered
misconceptions prevalent in this research area. Here the algorithmically
computed coupling geometry is shown consisting of deterministic multiscale
block patterns, which are framed by two marginal ultrametric trees on row and
column axes, and stochastic uniform randomness within each block found on the
finest scale. Functionally a series of increasingly larger ensembles of matrix
mimicries is derived by conforming to the multiscale block configurations. Here
matrix mimicking is meant to be subject to constraints of row and column sums
sequences. Based on such a series of ensembles, a profile of distributions
becomes a natural device for checking the validity of testing statistics or
structural indexes. An energy based index is used for testing whether network
data indeed contains structural geometry. A new version block-based nestedness
index is also proposed. Its validity is checked and compared with the existing
ones. A computing paradigm, called Data Mechanics, and its application on one
real data network are illustrated throughout the developments and discussions
in this paper.

21018,"MUSE-inspired view of the quasar Q2059-360, its Lyman alpha blob, and its neighborhood","  The radio-quiet quasar Q2059-360 at redshift $z=3.08$ is known to be close to
a small Lyman $\alpha$ blob (LAB) and to be absorbed by a proximate damped
Ly$\alpha$ (PDLA) system.
Here, we present the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field
spectroscopy follow-up of this quasi-stellar object (QSO). Our primary goal is
to characterize this LAB in detail by mapping it both spatially and spectrally
using the Ly$\alpha$ line, and by looking for high-ionization lines to
constrain the emission mechanism.
Combining the high sensitivity of the MUSE integral field spectrograph
mounted on the Yepun telescope at ESO-VLT with the natural coronagraph provided
by the PDLA, we map the LAB down to the QSO position, after robust subtraction
of QSO light in the spectral domain.
In addition to confirming earlier results for the small bright component of
the LAB, we unveil a faint filamentary emission protruding to the south over
about 80 pkpc (physical kpc); this results in a total size of about 120 pkpc.
We derive the velocity field of the LAB (assuming no transfer effects) and map
the Ly$\alpha$ line width. Upper limits are set to the flux of the N V $\lambda
1238-1242$, C IV $\lambda 1548-1551$, He II $\lambda 1640$, and C III] $\lambda
1548-1551$ lines. We have discovered two probable Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the
same redshift as the LAB and at projected distances of 265 kpc and 207 kpc from
the QSO; their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities might well be enhanced by the QSO
radiation. We also find an emission line galaxy at $z=0.33$ near the line of
sight to the QSO.
This LAB shares the same general characteristics as the 17 others surrounding
radio-quiet QSOs presented previously. However, there are indications that it
may be centered on the PDLA galaxy rather than on the QSO.

21019,Community Detection on Euclidean Random Graphs,"  We study the problem of community detection (CD) on Euclidean random
geometric graphs where each vertex has two latent variables: a binary community
label and a $\mathbb{R}^d$ valued location label which forms the support of a
Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda$. A random graph is then drawn with
edge probabilities dependent on both the community and location labels. In
contrast to the stochastic block model (SBM) that has no location labels, the
resulting random graph contains many more short loops due to the geometric
embedding. We consider the recovery of the community labels, partial and exact,
using the random graph and the location labels. We establish phase transitions
for both sparse and logarithmic degree regimes, and provide bounds on the
location of the thresholds, conjectured to be tight in the case of exact
recovery. We also show that the threshold of the distinguishability problem,
i.e., the testing between our model and the null model without community labels
exhibits no phase-transition and in particular, does not match the weak
recovery threshold (in contrast to the SBM).

21020,Load balancing with heterogeneous schedulers,"  Load balancing is a common approach in web server farms or inventory routing
problems. An important issue in such systems is to determine the server to
which an incoming request should be routed to optimize a given performance
criteria. In this paper, we assume the server's scheduling disciplines to be
heterogeneous. More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline
which belongs to the class of limited processor sharing (LPS-$d$) scheduling
disciplines. Under LPS-$d$, up to $d$ jobs can be served simultaneously, and
hence, includes as special cases First Come First Served ($d=1$) and Processor
Sharing ($d=\infty$).
In order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model the above load-balancing
framework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem. Using the relaxation
technique, as first developed in the seminal work of Whittle, we derive
Whittle's index policy for general cost functions and obtain a closed-form
expression for Whittle's index in terms of the steady-state distribution.
Through numerical computations, we investigate the performance of Whittle's
index with two different performance criteria: linear cost criterion and a cost
criterion that depends on the first and second moment of the throughput. Our
results show that \emph{(i)} the structure of Whittle's index policy can
strongly depend on the scheduling discipline implemented in the server, i.e.,
on $d$, and that \emph{(ii)} Whittle's index policy significantly outperforms
standard dispatching rules such as Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), Join the
Shortest Expected Workload (JSEW), and Random Server allocation (RSA).

21021,An Information Theoretic Framework for Active De-anonymization in Social Networks Based on Group Memberships,"  In this paper, a new mathematical formulation for the problem of
de-anonymizing social network users by actively querying their membership in
social network groups is introduced. In this formulation, the attacker has
access to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the
social network. When an unidentified victim visits a malicious website, the
attacker uses browser history sniffing to make queries regarding the victim's
social media activity. Particularly, it can make polar queries regarding the
victim's group memberships and the victim's identity. The attacker receives
noisy responses to her queries. The goal is to de-anonymize the victim with the
minimum number of queries. Starting with a rigorous mathematical model for this
active de-anonymization problem, an upper bound on the attacker's expected
query cost is derived, and new attack algorithms are proposed which achieve
this bound. These algorithms vary in computational cost and performance. The
results suggest that prior heuristic approaches to this problem provide
sub-optimal solutions.

21023,The effects of the overshooting of the convective core on main-sequence turnoffs of young- and intermediate-age star clusters,"  Recent investigations have shown that the extended main-sequence turnoffs
(eMSTOs) are a common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds. The eMSTOs are also found in the color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) of young-age star clusters. The origin of the eMSTOs is still an open
question. Moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting
parameter $\delta_{\rm ov}$ of the convective core is not fixed for the stars
with an approximatelly equal mass. Thus the MSTO of star clusters may be
affected by the overshooting of the convective core (OVCC). We calculated the
effects of the OVCC with different $\delta_{\rm ov}$ on the MSTO of young- and
intermediate-age star clusters. \textbf{If $\delta_{\rm ov}$ varies between
stars in a cluster,} the observed eMSTOs of young- and intermediate-age star
clusters can be explained well by the effects. The equivalent age spreads of
MSTO caused by the OVCC are related to the age of star clusters and are in good
agreement with observed results of many clusters. Moreover, the observed eMSTOs
of NGC 1856 are reproduced by the coeval populations with different
$\delta_{\rm ov}$. The eMSTOs of star clusters may be relevant to the effects
of the OVCC. The effects of the OVCC \textbf{are similar to that of rotation in
some respects. But the effects cannot result in a significant split of main
sequence of young star clusters at $m_{U}\lesssim 21$.} The presence of a rapid
rotation can make the split of main sequence of young star clusters more
significant.

the more frequently studied earthquake-generated tsunamis, and differ as well
from impact asteroids. Numerical simulations are presented using the shallow
water equations in several settings, demonstrating very little tsunami threat
from this scenario. A model problem with an explicit solution that demonstrates

discuss the question of whether compressibility and dispersion are important
effects that should be included, and show results from a more sophisticated
model problem using the linearized Euler equations that begins to addresses
this.

take into account the weakness, and propose a new design principle for
incrementally growing robust networks. The networks are self-organized by
enhancing interwoven long loops. In particular, we consider the range-limited
approximation of linking by intermediations in a few hops, and show the strong
robustness in the growth without degrading efficiency of paths. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the tolerance of connectivity is reformable even from
extremely vulnerable real networks according to our proposed growing process
with some investment. These results may indicate a prospective direction to the
future growth of our network infrastructures.

21027,Surrogate Losses for Online Learning of Stepsizes in Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization,"  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has played a central role in machine
learning. However, it requires a carefully hand-picked stepsize for fast
convergence, which is notoriously tedious and time-consuming to tune. Over the
last several years, a plethora of adaptive gradient-based algorithms have
emerged to ameliorate this problem. They have proved efficient in reducing the
labor of tuning in practice, but many of them lack theoretic guarantees even in
the convex setting. In this paper, we propose new surrogate losses to cast the
problem of learning the optimal stepsizes for the stochastic optimization of a
non-convex smooth objective function onto an online convex optimization
problem. This allows the use of no-regret online algorithms to compute optimal
stepsizes on the fly. In turn, this results in a SGD algorithm with self-tuned
stepsizes that guarantees convergence rates that are automatically adaptive to
the level of noise.

upon the existing results related to stationarity and ergodicity conditions of
such models. Proofs are based on theory developed for chains with complete
connections. This approach is based on a useful coupling technique which is
utilized for studying ergodicity of more general finite-state stochastic
processes. Such processes generalize finite-state Markov chains by assuming
infinite order models of past values. For finite order Markov chains, we also
discuss ergodicity properties when some strongly exogenous covariates are
considered in the dynamics of the process.

21029,Layered Coding for Energy Harvesting Communication Without CSIT,"  Due to stringent constraints on resources, it may be infeasible to acquire
the current channel state information at the transmitter in energy harvesting
communication systems. In this paper, we optimize an energy harvesting
transmitter, communicating over a slow fading channel, using layered coding.
The transmitter has access to the channel statistics, but does not know the
exact channel state. In layered coding, the codewords are first designed for
each of the channel states at different rates, and then the codewords are
either time-multiplexed or superimposed before the transmission, leading to two
transmission strategies. The receiver then decodes the information adaptively
based on the realized channel state. The transmitter is equipped with a
finite-capacity battery having non-zero internal resistance. In each of the
transmission strategies, we first formulate and study an average rate
maximization problem with non-causal knowledge of the harvested power
variations. Further, assuming statistical knowledge and causal information of
the harvested power variations, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm, and compare
with the stochastic dynamic programming based solution and a greedy policy.

obtained when the twisted polynomial $f\in K[t;\sigma]$ is invariant, and were
first defined by Petit. We compute all their automorphisms if $\sigma$ commutes

order of $\sigma$ and $m$ the degree of $f$,and obtain partial results for
$n<m-1$. In the case where $K/F$ is a finite Galois field extension, we obtain
more detailed information on the structure of the automorphism groups of these
nonassociative unital algebras over $F$. We also briefly investigate when two
such algebras are isomorphic.

21031,A convolutional autoencoder approach for mining features in cellular electron cryo-tomograms and weakly supervised coarse segmentation,"  Cellular electron cryo-tomography enables the 3D visualization of cellular
organization in the near-native state and at submolecular resolution. However,
the contents of cellular tomograms are often complex, making it difficult to
automatically isolate different in situ cellular components. In this paper, we
propose a convolutional autoencoder-based unsupervised approach to provide a
coarse grouping of 3D small subvolumes extracted from tomograms. We demonstrate
that the autoencoder can be used for efficient and coarse characterization of
features of macromolecular complexes and surfaces, such as membranes. In
addition, the autoencoder can be used to detect non-cellular features related
to sample preparation and data collection, such as carbon edges from the grid
and tomogram boundaries. The autoencoder is also able to detect patterns that
may indicate spatial interactions between cellular components. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our autoencoder can be used for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation of cellular components, requiring a very small amount of manual

21032,Probabilistic Rule Realization and Selection,"  Abstraction and realization are bilateral processes that are key in deriving
intelligence and creativity. In many domains, the two processes are approached
through rules: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet
diverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces, we
focus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample
distributions that follow the given rules. More ambitiously, we go beyond a
mechanical realization that takes whatever is given, but instead ask for
proactively selecting reasonable rules to realize. This goal is demanding in
practice, since the initial rule set may not always be consistent and thus
intelligent compromises are needed. We formulate both rule realization and
selection as two strongly connected components within a single and symmetric
bi-convex problem, and derive an efficient algorithm that works at large scale.
Taking music compositional rules as the main example throughout the paper, we
demonstrate our model's efficiency in not only music realization (composition)
but also music interpretation and understanding (analysis).

identified that can be used to characterize various flow regimes. We
investigate the relative importance of stem aspect ratio versus anisotropy in
the sapwood hydraulic conductivity, and how these two effects impact the radial

21034,Risk Estimators for Choosing Regularization Parameters in Ill-Posed Problems - Properties and Limitations,"  This paper discusses the properties of certain risk estimators recently
proposed to choose regularization parameters in ill-posed problems. A simple
approach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in
the data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the
space of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more
appropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do
not tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical
studies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite
dimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also
leads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends
to infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with
a very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the
risk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical
results indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate
asymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed
numerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads
to extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize
the reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness
also appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather
conservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization
parameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure
for ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization
demonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational
regularization approaches.

validated against several years of actual wind power data. System load modeling
was carried out by analyzing the seasonal trends that occur in residential,
commercial, and industrial loads. When the proposed approach was implemented on
the IEEE 118-bus system, it could identify violations in bus voltage profiles

However, such demonstrations are often imperfect since collecting optimal ones

demonstrations. More specifically, we propose two confidence-based IL methods,
namely two-step importance weighting IL (2IWIL) and generative adversarial IL
with imperfect demonstration and confidence (IC-GAIL). We show that confidence
scores given only to a small portion of sub-optimal demonstrations
significantly improve the performance of IL both theoretically and empirically.

21038,Control-Oriented Learning on the Fly,"  This paper focuses on developing a strategy for control of systems whose
dynamics are almost entirely unknown. This situation arises naturally in a
scenario where a system undergoes a critical failure. In that case, it is
imperative to retain the ability to satisfy basic control objectives in order
to avert an imminent catastrophe. A prime example of such an objective is the
reach-avoid problem, where a system needs to move to a certain state in a
constrained state space. To deal with limitations on our knowledge of system
dynamics, we develop a theory of myopic control. The primary goal of myopic
control is to, at any given time, optimize the current direction of the system
trajectory, given solely the information obtained about the system until that
time. We propose an algorithm that uses small perturbations in the control
effort to learn local dynamics while simultaneously ensuring that the system
moves in a direction that appears to be nearly optimal, and provide hard bounds
for its suboptimality. We additionally verify the usefulness of the algorithm
on a simulation of a damaged aircraft seeking to avoid a crash, as well as on
an example of a Van der Pol oscillator.

21040,Matrix Completion from $O(n)$ Samples in Linear Time,"  We consider the problem of reconstructing a rank-$k$ $n \times n$ matrix $M$
from a sampling of its entries. Under a certain incoherence assumption on $M$
and for the case when both the rank and the condition number of $M$ are
bounded, it was shown in \cite{CandesRecht2009, CandesTao2010, keshavan2010,
Recht2011, Jain2012, Hardt2014} that $M$ can be recovered exactly or
approximately (depending on some trade-off between accuracy and computational
complexity) using $O(n \, \text{poly}(\log n))$ samples in super-linear time
$O(n^{a} \, \text{poly}(\log n))$ for some constant $a \geq 1$.
In this paper, we propose a new matrix completion algorithm using a novel
sampling scheme based on a union of independent sparse random regular bipartite
graphs. We show that under the same conditions w.h.p. our algorithm recovers an
$\epsilon$-approximation of $M$ in terms of the Frobenius norm using $O(n
\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ samples and in linear time $O(n \log^2(1/\epsilon))$. This
provides the best known bounds both on the sample complexity and computational
complexity for reconstructing (approximately) an unknown low-rank matrix.
The novelty of our algorithm is two new steps of thresholding singular values
and rescaling singular vectors in the application of the ""vanilla"" alternating
minimization algorithm. The structure of sparse random regular graphs is used
heavily for controlling the impact of these regularization steps.

21041,"Ingestion, Indexing and Retrieval of High-Velocity Multidimensional Sensor Data on a Single Node","  Multidimensional data are becoming more prevalent, partly due to the rise of
the Internet of Things (IoT), and with that the need to ingest and analyze data
streams at rates higher than before. Some industrial IoT applications require
ingesting millions of records per second, while processing queries on recently
ingested and historical data. Unfortunately, existing database systems suited
to multidimensional data exhibit low per-node ingestion performance, and even
if they can scale horizontally in distributed settings, they require large
number of nodes to meet such ingest demands. For this reason, in this paper we
evaluate a single-node multidimensional data store for high-velocity sensor
data. Its design centers around a two-level indexing structure, wherein the
global index is an in-memory R*-tree and the local indices are serialized
kd-trees. This study is confined to records with numerical indexing fields and
range queries, and covers ingest throughput, query response time, and storage
footprint. We show that the adopted design streamlines data ingestion and
offers ingress rates two orders of magnitude higher than those of Percona
Server, SQLite, and Druid. Our prototype also reports query response times
comparable to or better than those of Percona Server and Druid, and compares
favorably in terms of storage footprint. In addition, we evaluate a kd-tree
partitioning based scheme for grouping incoming streamed data records. Compared
to a random scheme, this scheme produces less overlap between groups of
streamed records, but contrary to what we expected, such reduced overlap does
not translate into better query performance. By contrast, the local indices
prove much more beneficial to query performance. We believe the experience
reported in this paper is valuable to practitioners and researchers alike
interested in building database systems for high-velocity multidimensional
data.

21042,Electron and thermal transport via Variable Range Hopping in MoSe$_{2}$ single crystals,"  Bulk single crystal Molybdenum diselenide has been studied for its electronic
and thermal transport properties. We perform resistivity measurements with
current in-plane (CIP) and current perpendicular to plane (CPP) as a function
of temperature. The CIP measurements exhibit metal to semiconductor transition
at $\simeq 31$ K. In the semiconducting phase ($T > 31$ K), the transport is
best explained by variable range hopping (VRH) model. Large magnitude of
resistivity in CPP mode indicates strong structural anisotropy. Seebeck
coefficient as a function of temperature measured in the range $90 - 300$ K,
also agrees well with the VRH model. The room temperature Seebeck coefficient
is found to be $139$ $\mu$V/K. VRH fittings of the resistivity and Seebeck
coefficient data indicate high degree of localization.

21043,Ball in double hoop: demonstration model for numerical optimal control,"  Ball and hoop system is a well-known model for the education of linear
control systems. In this paper, we have a look at this system from another
perspective and show that it is also suitable for demonstration of more
advanced control techniques. In contrast to the standard use, we describe the
dynamics of the system at full length; in addition to the mode where the ball
rolls on the (outer) hoop we also consider the mode where the ball drops out of
the hoop and enters a free-fall mode. Furthermore, we add another (inner) hoop
in the center upon which the ball can land from the free-fall mode. This
constitutes another mode of the hybrid description of the system. We present
two challenging tasks for this model and show how they can be solved by
trajectory generation and stabilization. We also describe how such a model can
be built and experimentally verify the validity of our approach solving the
proposed tasks.

21044,Forecasting market states,"  We propose a novel methodology to define, analyse and forecast market states.
In our approach market states are identified by a reference sparse precision
matrix and a vector of expectation values. In our procedure each multivariate
observation is associated to a given market state accordingly to a penalized
likelihood maximization. The procedure is made computationally very efficient
and can be used with a large number of assets. We demonstrate that this
procedure successfully classifies different states of the markets in an
unsupervised manner. In particular, we describe an experiment with one hundred
log-returns and two states in which the methodology automatically associates
one state to periods with average positive returns and the other state to
periods with average negative returns, therefore discovering spontaneously the
common classification of `bull' and `bear' markets. In another experiment, with
again one hundred log-returns and two states, we demonstrate that this
procedure can be efficiently used to forecast off-sample future market states
with significant prediction accuracy. This methodology opens the way to a range
of applications in risk management and trading strategies where the correlation
structure plays a central role.

includes an extensive coverage of all kinds of ring modes dynamics (except
density waves which have been covered in part 1), the origin of ring
eccentricities and mode amplitudes, and the issue of ring/gap confinement. This
still leaves aside a number of important dynamical issues relating to the ring
small scale structure, most notably the dynamics of self-gravitational wakes,
of local viscous overstabilities and of ballistic transport processes.
As this material is designed to be self-contained, there is some 30% overlap

21046,Parallel Streaming Wasserstein Barycenters,"  Efficiently aggregating data from different sources is a challenging problem,
particularly when samples from each source are distributed differently. These
differences can be inherent to the inference task or present for other reasons:
sensors in a sensor network may be placed far apart, affecting their individual
measurements. Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian
inference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically
distributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability
distributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter
is a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while
respecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and
requires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself.
Improving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-efficient,
parallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary
distributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input
distributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to
nonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that
tracks the input measures over time. The algorithm is semi-discrete, needing to
discretize only the barycenter estimate. To the best of our knowledge, we also
provide the first bounds on the quality of the approximate barycenter as the
discretization becomes finer. Finally, we demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of our method, both in tracking moving distributions on a sphere,
as well as in a large-scale Bayesian inference task.

21048,GoDP: Globally optimized dual pathway system for facial landmark localization in-the-wild,"  Facial landmark localization is a fundamental module for pose-invariant face
recognition. The most common approach for facial landmark detection is cascaded
regression, which is composed of two steps: feature extraction and facial shape
regression. Recent methods employ deep convolutional networks to extract robust
features for each step, while the whole system could be regarded as a deep
cascaded regression architecture. In this work, instead of employing a deep
regression network, a Globally Optimized Dual-Pathway (GoDP) deep architecture
is proposed to identify the target pixels through solving a cascaded pixel
labeling problem without resorting to high-level inference models or complex
stacked architecture. The proposed end-to-end system relies on distance-aware
softmax functions and dual-pathway proposal-refinement architecture. Results
show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art cascaded regression-based methods
on multiple in-the-wild face alignment databases. The model achieves 1.84
normalized mean error (NME) on the AFLW database, which outperforms 3DDFA by
61.8%. Experiments on face identification demonstrate that GoDP, coupled with
DPM-headhunter, is able to improve rank-1 identification rate by 44.2% compared
to Dlib toolbox on a challenging database.

21050,Cell growth rate dictates the onset of glass to fluid-like transition and long time super-diffusion in an evolving cell colony,"  Collective migration dominates many phenomena, from cell movement in living
systems to abiotic self-propelling particles. Focusing on the early stages of
tumor evolution, we enunciate the principles involved in cell dynamics and
highlight their implications in understanding similar behavior in seemingly
unrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of
CD8$^{+}$ T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal
three dimensional model, accounting for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell
interactions as well as cell birth and death to establish that cell growth
rate-dependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological
niches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the
tumor boundary, while motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The
mean square displacement, $\Delta(t)$, of cells exhibits glassy behavior at
times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive
behavior, $\Delta (t) \approx t^{\alpha}$ ($\alpha > 1$), at longer times. We
derive the value of $\alpha \approx 1.33$ using a field theoretic approach
based on stochastic quantization. In the process we establish the universality
of super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium systems.
Super diffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell
birth and death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also
suggests that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative
agreement with {\it in vitro} experiments. Although set in the context of tumor
invasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion in
growing cells and in active systems where creation and annihilation of
particles play a role.

21051,Distributed Average Tracking for Lipschitz-Type Nonlinear Dynamical Systems,"  In this paper, a distributed average tracking problem is studied for
Lipschitz-type nonlinear dynamical systems. The objective is to design
distributed average tracking algorithms for locally interactive agents to track
the average of multiple reference signals. Here, in both the agents' and the
reference signals' dynamics, there is a nonlinear term satisfying the
Lipschitz-type condition. Three types of distributed average tracking
algorithms are designed. First, based on state-dependent-gain designing
approaches, a robust distributed average tracking algorithm is developed to
solve distributed average tracking problems without requiring the same initial
condition. Second, by using a gain adaption scheme, an adaptive distributed
average tracking algorithm is proposed in this paper to remove the requirement
that the Lipschitz constant is known for agents. Third, to reduce chattering
and make the algorithms easier to implement, a continuous distributed average
tracking algorithm based on a time-varying boundary layer is further designed
as a continuous approximation of the previous discontinuous distributed average
tracking algorithms.

posets. We prove our results using a poset fibration based on the embeddings of
the poset, where embeddings are representations of occurrences. We show that
the MÃ¶bius function of these posets is intrinsically linked to the number of
embeddings, and in particular to so called normal embeddings. We present
results on when topological properties such as Cohen-Macaulayness and
shellability are preserved by this fibration. Furthermore, we apply these
results to some pattern posets and derive alternative proofs of existing
results, such as BjÃ¶rner's results on subword order.

21054,The scaling limit of the KPZ equation in space dimension 3 and higher,"  We study in the present article the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation $$
\partial_t h(t,x)=\nu\Delta h(t,x)+\lambda |\nabla h(t,x)|^2 +\sqrt{D}\,
\eta(t,x), \qquad (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}^d $$ in $d\ge 3$
dimensions in the perturbative regime, i.e. for $\lambda>0$ small enough and a
smooth, bounded, integrable initial condition $h_0=h(t=0,\cdot)$. The forcing
term $\eta$ in the right-hand side is a regularized space-time white noise. The
exponential of $h$ -- its so-called Cole-Hopf transform -- is known to satisfy
a linear PDE with multiplicative noise. We prove a large-scale diffusive limit
for the solution, in particular a time-integrated heat-kernel behavior for the
covariance in a parabolic scaling.
The proof is based on a rigorous implementation of K. Wilson's
renormalization group scheme. A double cluster/momentum-decoupling expansion
allows for perturbative estimates of the bare resolvent of the Cole-Hopf linear
PDE in the small-field region where the noise is not too large, following the
broad lines of Iagolnitzer-Magnen. Standard large deviation estimates for
$\eta$ make it possible to extend the above estimates to the large-field
region. Finally, we show, by resumming all the by-products of the expansion,
that the solution $h$ may be written in the large-scale limit (after a suitable
Galilei transformation) as a small perturbation of the solution of the
underlying linear Edwards-Wilkinson model ($\lambda=0$) with renormalized
coefficients $\nu_{eff}=\nu+O(\lambda^2),D_{eff}=D+O(\lambda^2)$.

21055,Beyond Free Riding: Quality of Indicators for Assessing Participation in Information Sharing for Threat Intelligence,"  Threat intelligence sharing has become a growing concept, whereby entities
can exchange patterns of threats with each other, in the form of indicators, to
a community of trust for threat analysis and incident response. However,
sharing threat-related information have posed various risks to an organization
that pertains to its security, privacy, and competitiveness. Given the
coinciding benefits and risks of threat information sharing, some entities have
adopted an elusive behavior of ""free-riding"" so that they can acquire the
benefits of sharing without contributing much to the community. So far,
understanding the effectiveness of sharing has been viewed from the perspective
of the amount of information exchanged as opposed to its quality. In this
paper, we introduce the notion of quality of indicators (\qoi) for the
assessment of the level of contribution by participants in information sharing
for threat intelligence. We exemplify this notion through various metrics,
including correctness, relevance, utility, and uniqueness of indicators. In
order to realize the notion of \qoi, we conducted an empirical study and taken
a benchmark approach to define quality metrics, then we obtained a reference
dataset and utilized tools from the machine learning literature for quality
assessment. We compared these results against a model that only considers the
volume of information as a metric for contribution, and unveiled various
interesting observations, including the ability to spot low quality
contributions that are synonym to free riding in threat information sharing.

21056,On the Design of LQR Kernels for Efficient Controller Learning,"  Finding optimal feedback controllers for nonlinear dynamic systems from data
is hard. Recently, Bayesian optimization (BO) has been proposed as a powerful
framework for direct controller tuning from experimental trials. For selecting
the next query point and finding the global optimum, BO relies on a
probabilistic description of the latent objective function, typically a
Gaussian process (GP). As is shown herein, GPs with a common kernel choice can,
however, lead to poor learning outcomes on standard quadratic control problems.
For a first-order system, we construct two kernels that specifically leverage
the structure of the well-known Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), yet retain
the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric learning. Simulations of uncertain
linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate that the LQR kernels yield superior
learning performance.

21057,How does propaganda influence the opinion dynamics of a population ?,"  The evolution of opinions in a population of individuals who constantly
interact with a common source of user-generated content (i.e. the internet) and
are also subject to propaganda is analyzed using computer simulations. The
model is based on the bounded confidence approach. In the absence of
propaganda, computer simulations show that the online population as a whole is
either fragmented, polarized or in perfect harmony on a certain issue or
ideology depending on the uncertainty of individuals in accepting opinions not
closer to theirs. On applying the model to simulate radicalization, a
proportion of the online population, subject to extremist propaganda radicalize
depending on their pre-conceived opinions and opinion uncertainty. It is found
that an optimal counter propaganda that prevents radicalization is not
necessarily centrist.

21058,Explicit Solution for Constrained Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Control with Multiplicative Noise,"  We study in this paper a class of constrained linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal
control problem formulations for the scalar-state stochastic system with
multiplicative noise, which has various applications, especially in the
financial risk management. The linear constraint on both the control and state
variables considered in our model destroys the elegant structure of the
conventional LQ formulation and has blocked the derivation of an explicit
control policy so far in the literature. We successfully derive in this paper
the analytical control policy for such a class of problems by utilizing the
state separation property induced from its structure. We reveal that the
optimal control policy is a piece-wise affine function of the state and can be
computed off-line efficiently by solving two coupled Riccati equations. Under
some mild conditions, we also obtain the stationary control policy for infinite
time horizon. We demonstrate the implementation of our method via some
illustrative examples and show how to calibrate our model to solve dynamic
constrained portfolio optimization problems.

21059,Viewpoint Selection for Photographing Architectures,"  This paper studies the problem of how to choose good viewpoints for taking

photographs of world famous landmarks that are available on the Internet.
Unlike previous efforts devoted to photo quality assessment which mainly rely
on 2D image features, we show in this paper combining 2D image features
extracted from images with 3D geometric features computed on the 3D models can
result in more reliable evaluation of viewpoint quality. Specifically, we
collect a set of photographs for each of 15 world famous architectures as well
as their 3D models from the Internet. Viewpoint recovery for images is carried
out through an image-model registration process, after which a newly proposed
viewpoint clustering strategy is exploited to validate users' viewpoint
preferences when photographing landmarks. Finally, we extract a number of 2D
and 3D features for each image based on multiple visual and geometric cues and
perform viewpoint recommendation by learning from both 2D and 3D features using
a specifically designed SVM-2K multi-view learner, achieving superior
performance over using solely 2D or 3D features. We show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach through extensive experiments. The experiments also
demonstrate that our system can be used to recommend viewpoints for rendering
textured 3D models of buildings for the use of architectural design, in
addition to viewpoint evaluation of photographs and recommendation of
viewpoints for photographing architectures in practice.

21060,Geophysical tests for habitability in ice-covered ocean worlds,"  Geophysical measurements can reveal the structure of icy ocean worlds and
cycling of volatiles. The associated density, temperature, sound speed, and
electrical conductivity of such worlds thus characterizes their habitability.
To explore the variability and correlation of these parameters, and to provide
tools for planning and data analyses, we develop 1-D calculations of internal
structure, which use available constraints on the thermodynamics of aqueous
MgSO$_4$, NaCl (as seawater), and NH$_3$, water ices, and silicate content.
Limits in available thermodynamic data narrow the parameter space that can be
explored: insufficient coverage in pressure, temperature, and composition for
end-member salinities of MgSO$_4$ and NaCl, and for relevant water ices; and a
dearth of suitable data for aqueous mixtures of Na-Mg-Cl-SO$_4$-NH$_3$. For
Europa, ocean compositions that are oxidized and dominated by MgSO$_4$, vs
reduced (NaCl), illustrate these gaps, but also show the potential for
diagnostic and measurable combinations of geophysical parameters. The
low-density rocky core of Enceladus may comprise hydrated minerals, or anydrous
minerals with high porosity comparable to Earth's upper mantle. Titan's ocean
must be dense, but not necessarily saline, as previously noted, and may have
little or no high-pressure ice at its base. Ganymede's silicious interior is
deepest among all known ocean worlds, and may contain multiple phases of
high-pressure ice, which will become buoyant if the ocean is sufficiently
salty. Callisto's likely near-eutectic ocean cannot be adequately modeled using
available data. Callisto may also lack high-pressure ices, but this cannot be
confirmed due to uncertainty in its moment of inertia.

laboratory testing was supported as were routine mission operations. {Methods}.
A modular software design allowed components to be easily added, removed,

and after mission operations. {Results}. The HIFI pipeline processed data from
all HIFI observing modes within the Herschel automated processing environment
as well as within an interactive environment. The same software can be used by
the general astronomical community to reprocess any standard HIFI observation.
The pipeline also recorded the consistency of processing results and provided
automated quality reports. Many pipeline modules were in use since the HIFI
pre-launch instrument level testing. {Conclusions}. Processing in steps
facilitated data analysis to discover and address instrument artefacts and
uncertainties. The availability of the same pipeline components from pre-launch
throughout the mission made for well-understood, tested, and stable processing.

Subsequently, we clarify the equivalence between regret minimization in dueling

considering a lower bound in convex optimization, our algorithm is shown to
achieve the optimal convergence rate in convex optimization and the optimal

protoplanetary disks and meteorites has been proposed to be the result of
ionizing radiation. The goal of this study is to quantify the effects of soft
X-rays (0.1 - 2 keV), a component of stellar radiation fields illuminating
protoplanetary disks, on the refractory organics present in the disks. We
prepared tholins, nitrogen-rich complex organics, via plasma deposition and
used synchrotron radiation to simulate X-ray fluences in protoplanetary disks.
Controlled irradiation experiments at 0.5 and 1.3 keV were performed at the
SEXTANTS beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron, and were followed by ex-situ
infrared, Raman and isotopic diagnostics. Infrared spectroscopy revealed the
loss of singly-bonded groups (N-H, C-H and R-N$\equiv$C) and the formation of
sp$^3$ carbon defects. Raman analysis revealed the introduction of defects and
structural amorphization. Finally, tholins were measured via secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS), revealing that significant D-enrichment is induced by
X-ray irradiation. Our results are compared to previous experimental studies
involving the thermal degradation and electron irradiation of organics. The
penetration depth of soft X-rays in $\mu$m-sized tholins leads to volume rather
than surface modifications: lower energy X-rays (0.5 keV) induce a larger
D-enrichment than 1.3 keV X-rays, reaching a plateau for doses larger than 5
$\times$ 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-3}$. Our work provides experimental evidence of a
new non-thermal pathway to deuterium fractionation of organic matter.

Through conditioning and invariance arguments, we show that these distributions
do not involve nuisance parameters. In particular, this applies to several test
statistics for which no finite-sample distributional theory is yet available,
such as the standard statistic proposed by Hausman (1978). The distributions of
the test statistics may be non-standard -- so corrections to usual asymptotic
critical values are needed -- but the characterizations are sufficiently
explicit to yield finite-sample (Monte-Carlo) tests of the exogeneity
hypothesis. The procedures so obtained are robust to weak identification,
missing instruments or misspecified reduced forms, and can easily be adapted to
allow for parametric non-Gaussian error distributions. We give a general
invariance result (block triangular invariance) for exogeneity test statistics.
This property yields a convenient exogeneity canonical form and a parsimonious
reduction of the parameters on which power depends. In the extreme case where
no structural parameter is identified, the distributions under the alternative
hypothesis and the null hypothesis are identical, so the power function is
flat, for all the exogeneity statistics. However, as soon as identification
does not fail completely, this phenomenon typically disappears.

21069,Pair formation of hard core bosons in flat band systems,"  Hard core bosons in a large class of one or two dimensional flat band systems
have an upper critical density, below which the ground states can be described
completely. At the critical density, the ground states are Wigner crystals. If
one adds a particle to the system at the critical density, the ground state and
the low lying multi particle states of the system can be described as a Wigner
crystal with an additional pair of particles. The energy band for the pair is
separated from the rest of the multi-particle spectrum. The proofs use a
Gerschgorin type of argument for block diagonally dominant matrices. In certain
one-dimensional or tree-like structures one can show that the pair is
localised, for example in the chequerboard chain. For this one-dimensional
system with periodic boundary condition the energy band for the pair is flat,
the pair is localised.

of 3D Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) from Amdahl law perspective. We find that 3D
CMP may reach its thermal limit before reaching its maximum power. We show that
a high level of parallelism may lead to high peak temperatures even in small
scale 3D CMPs, thus limiting 3D CMP scalability and calling for different,
in-memory computing architectures.

21072,Video Object Segmentation using Supervoxel-Based Gerrymandering,"  Pixels operate locally. Superpixels have some potential to collect
information across many pixels; supervoxels have more potential by implicitly
operating across time. In this paper, we explore this well established notion
thoroughly analyzing how supervoxels can be used in place of and in conjunction
with other means of aggregating information across space-time. Focusing on the
problem of strictly unsupervised video object segmentation, we devise a method
called supervoxel gerrymandering that links masks of foregroundness and
backgroundness via local and non-local consensus measures. We pose and answer a
series of critical questions about the ability of supervoxels to adequately
sway local voting; the questions regard type and scale of supervoxels as well
as local versus non-local consensus, and the questions are posed in a general
way so as to impact the broader knowledge of the use of supervoxels in video
understanding. We work with the DAVIS dataset and find that our analysis yields
an unsupervised method that outperforms all other known unsupervised methods
and even many supervised ones.

21073,The Absent-Minded Driver Problem Redux,"  This paper reconsiders the problem of the absent-minded driver who must
choose between alternatives with different payoff with imperfect recall and
varying degrees of knowledge of the system. The classical absent-minded driver
problem represents the case with limited information and it has bearing on the
general area of communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design,
auctions, theories of knowledge, belief, and rational agency. Within the
framework of extensive games, this problem has applications to many artificial
intelligence scenarios. It is obvious that the performance of the agent
improves as information available increases. It is shown that a non-uniform
assignment strategy for successive choices does better than a fixed probability
strategy. We consider both classical and quantum approaches to the problem. We
argue that the superior performance of quantum decisions with access to
entanglement cannot be fairly compared to a classical algorithm. If the
cognitive systems of agents are taken to have access to quantum resources, or
have a quantum mechanical basis, then that can be leveraged into superior
performance.

21074,Real-time Acceleration-continuous Path-constrained Trajectory Planning With Built-in Tradability Between Cruise and Time-optimal Motions,"  In this paper, a novel real-time acceleration-continuous path-constrained
trajectory planning algorithm is proposed with an appealing built-in
tradability mechanism between cruise motion and time-optimal motion. Different
from existing approaches, the proposed approach smoothens time-optimal
trajectories with bang-bang input structures to generate
acceleration-continuous trajectories while preserving the completeness
property. More importantly, a novel built-in tradability mechanism is proposed
and embedded into the trajectory planning framework, so that the proportion of
the cruise motion and time-optimal motion can be flexibly adjusted by changing
a user-specified functional parameter. Thus, the user can easily apply the
trajectory planning algorithm for various tasks with different requirements on
motion efficiency and cruise proportion. Moreover, it is shown that feasible
trajectories are computed more quickly than optimal trajectories. Rigorous
mathematical analysis and proofs are provided for these aforementioned results.
Comparative simulation and experimental results on omnidirectional wheeled
mobile robots demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm in terms of
flexible tunning between cruise and time-optimal motions, as well as higher
computational efficiency.

21075,Multi-locus data distinguishes between population growth and multiple merger coalescents,"  We introduce a low dimensional function of the site frequency spectrum that
is tailor-made for distinguishing coalescent models with multiple mergers from
Kingman coalescent models with population growth, and use this function to
construct a hypothesis test between these model classes. The null and
alternative sampling distributions of the statistic are intractable, but its
low dimensionality renders them amenable to Monte Carlo estimation. We
construct kernel density estimates of the sampling distributions based on
simulated data, and show that the resulting hypothesis test dramatically
improves on the statistical power of a current state-of-the-art method. A key
reason for this improvement is the use of multi-locus data, in particular
averaging observed site frequency spectra across unlinked loci to reduce
sampling variance. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to nuisance
and tuning parameters. Finally we show that the same kernel density estimates
can be used to conduct parameter estimation, and argue that our method is
readily generalisable for applications in model selection, parameter inference
and experimental design.

21076,Ramsey interferometry of Rydberg ensembles inside microwave cavities,"  We study ensembles of Rydberg atoms in a confined electromagnetic environment
such as provided by a microwave cavity. The competition between standard free
space Ising type and cavity-mediated interactions leads to the emergence of
different regimes where the particle-particle couplings range from the typical
van der Waals $r^{-6}$ behavior to $r^{-3}$ and to $r$-independence. We apply a
Ramsey spectroscopic technique to map the two-body interactions into a
characteristic signal such as intensity and contrast decay curves. As opposed
to previous treatments requiring high-densities for considerable contrast and
phase decay, the cavity scenario can exhibit similar behavior at much lower
densities.

21077,Impurity self-energy in the strongly-correlated Bose systems,"  We proposed the non-perturbative scheme for calculation of the impurity
spectrum in the Bose system at zero temperature. The method is based on the
path-integral formulation and describes an impurity as a zero-density ideal
Fermi gas interacting with Bose system for which the action is written in terms
of density fluctuations. On the example of the $^3$He atom immersed in the
liquid helium-4 a good consistency with experimental data and results of Monte
Carlo simulations is shown.

21078,$k$-step correction for mixed integer linear programming: a new approach for instrumental variable quantile regressions and related problems,"  This paper proposes a new framework for estimating instrumental variable (IV)
quantile models. The first part of our proposal can be cast as a mixed integer
linear program (MILP), which allows us to capitalize on recent progress in
mixed integer optimization. The computational advantage of the proposed method
makes it an attractive alternative to existing estimators in the presence of
multiple endogenous regressors. This is a situation that arises naturally when
one endogenous variable is interacted with several other variables in a
regression equation. In our simulations, the proposed method using MILP with a
random starting point can reliably estimate regressions for a sample size of
500 with 20 endogenous variables in 5 seconds. Theoretical results for early
termination of MILP are also provided. The second part of our proposal is a
$k$-step correction framework, which is proved to be able to convert any point
within a small but fixed neighborhood of the true parameter value into an
estimate that is asymptotically equivalent to GMM. Our result does not require
the initial estimate to be consistent and only $2\log n$ iterations are needed.
Since the $k$-step correction does not require any optimization, applying the
$k$-step correction to MILP estimate provides a computationally attractive way
of obtaining efficient estimators. When dealing with very large data sets, we
can run the MILP algorithm on only a small subsample and our theoretical
results guarantee that the resulting estimator from the $k$-step correction is
equivalent to computing GMM on the full sample. As a result, we can handle
massive datasets of millions of observations within seconds. As an empirical
illustration, we examine the heterogeneous treatment effect of Job Training
Partnership Act (JTPA) using a regression with 13 interaction terms of the
treatment variable.

21079,An MCMC Algorithm for Estimating the Reduced RUM,"  The RRUM is a model that is frequently seen in language assessment studies.
The objective of this research is to advance an MCMC algorithm for the Bayesian
RRUM. The algorithm starts with estimating correlated attributes. Using a
saturated model and a binary decimal conversion, the algorithm transforms
possible attribute patterns to a Multinomial distribution. Along with the
likelihood of an attribute pattern, a Dirichlet distribution is used as the
prior to sample from the posterior. The Dirichlet distribution is constructed
using Gamma distributions. Correlated attributes of examinees are generated
using the inverse transform sampling. Model parameters are estimated using the
Metropolis within Gibbs sampler sequentially. Two simulation studies are
conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The first simulation
uses a complete and balanced Q-matrix that measures 5 attributes. Comprised of
28 items and 9 attributes, the Q-matrix for the second simulation is incomplete
and imbalanced. The empirical study uses the ECPE data obtained from the CDM R
package. Parameter estimates from the MCMC algorithm and from the CDM R package
are presented and compared. The algorithm developed in this research is
implemented in R.

21080,Stretching p-wave molecules by transverse confinements,"  We revisit the confinement-induced p-wave resonance in quasi-one-dimensional
(quasi-1D) atomic gases and study the induced molecules near resonance. We
derive the reduced 1D interaction parameters and show that they can well
predict the binding energy of shallow molecules in quasi-1D system.
Importantly, these shallow molecules are found to be much more spatially
extended compared to those in three dimensions (3D) without transverse
confinement. Our results strongly indicate that a p-wave interacting atomic gas
can be much more stable in quasi-1D near the induced p-wave resonance, where
most weight of the molecule lies outside the short-range regime and thus the
atom loss could be suppressed.

21081,A Conceptual Framework for Supporting a Rapid Design of Web Applications for Data Analysis of Electrical Quality Assurance Data for the LHC,"  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the most complex machines ever
build. It is composed of many components which constitute a large system. The
tunnel and the accelerator is just one of a very critical fraction of the whole
LHC infrastructure. Hardware comissioning as one of the critical processes
before running the LHC is implemented during the Long Shutdown (LS) states of
the macine, where Electrical Quality Assurance (ELQA) is one of its key
components. Here a huge data is collected when implementing various ELQA
electrical tests. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for
supporting a rapid design of web applications for ELQA data analysis. We show a
framework's main components, their possible integration with other systems and
machine learning algorithms and a simple use case of prototyping an application
for Electrical Quality Assurance of the LHC.

21082,The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a Multilingual Corpus of Translations Annotated with Compositional Meaning Representations,"  The Parallel Meaning Bank is a corpus of translations annotated with shared,
formal meaning representations comprising over 11 million words divided over
four languages (English, German, Italian, and Dutch). Our approach is based on
cross-lingual projection: automatically produced (and manually corrected)
semantic annotations for English sentences are mapped onto their word-aligned
translations, assuming that the translations are meaning-preserving. The
semantic annotation consists of five main steps: (i) segmentation of the text
in sentences and lexical items; (ii) syntactic parsing with Combinatory
Categorial Grammar; (iii) universal semantic tagging; (iv) symbolization; and
(v) compositional semantic analysis based on Discourse Representation Theory.
These steps are performed using statistical models trained in a semi-supervised
manner. The employed annotation models are all language-neutral. Our first
results are promising.

21083,A nonparametric copula approach to conditional Value-at-Risk,"  Value-at-Risk and its conditional allegory, which takes into account the
available information about the economic environment, form the centrepiece of
the Basel framework for the evaluation of market risk in the banking sector. In
this paper, a new nonparametric framework for estimating this conditional
Value-at-Risk is presented. A nonparametric approach is particularly pertinent
as the traditionally used parametric distributions have been shown to be
insufficiently robust and flexible in most of the equity-return data sets
observed in practice. The method extracts the quantile of the conditional
distribution of interest, whose estimation is based on a novel estimator of the
density of the copula describing the dynamic dependence observed in the series
of returns. Real-world back-testing analyses demonstrate the potential of the
approach, whose performance may be superior to its industry counterparts.

21084,Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices,"  Superfluidity is a special state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum
phenomena and acting like a fluid with zero viscosity. In such a state,
superfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with
unique distributions. This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual
understanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear
Klein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to
special vortex lattice/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation,
reconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc. By formulating a numerical model with
theoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality
superfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex
visualization. By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a
new vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with
velocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane
strategy to avoid ambiguity. Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various
superfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual
analysis, such as the steady vortex lattice/ring structures, dynamic vortex
string interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous
Kelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed. These
visualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and
further explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.

the second half. An edge-coloring of a graph is repetition-free or
nonrepetitive if there is no path with a color pattern that is a repetition.
The minimum number of colors so that a graph has a nonrepetitive edge-coloring
is called its Thue edge-chromatic number.
We improve on the best known general upper bound of $4\Delta-4$ for the Thue
edge-chromatic number of trees of maximum degree $\Delta$ due to Alon,
Grytczuk, Ha{\l}uszczak and Riordan (2002) by providing a simple nonrepetitive

circular rod. Sine-Gordon expansion method is based on the well-known
sine-Gordon equation and a wave transformation. The longitudinal wave equation
is an equation that arises in mathematical physics with dispersion caused by
the transverse Poisson's effect in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod. We
successfully get some solutions with the complex, trigonometric and hyperbolic

solutions by choosing appropriate values of the parameters. We give the
physical meanings of some of the obtained analytical solutions which

21087,Formulation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture Toward Autonomous Driving for On-Ramp Merge,"  Multiple automakers have in development or in production automated driving
systems (ADS) that offer freeway-pilot functions. This type of ADS is typically
limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual
to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed
manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that
the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives
(e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely
executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other
vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the
merging vehicle optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem,
we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an
optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive
environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state
containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network
(DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal
state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this
DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the
long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the
optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be
extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving
through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow
conditions.

21088,CDS Rate Construction Methods by Machine Learning Techniques,"  Regulators require financial institutions to estimate counterparty default
risks from liquid CDS quotes for the valuation and risk management of OTC
derivatives. However, the vast majority of counterparties do not have liquid
CDS quotes and need proxy CDS rates. Existing methods cannot account for
counterparty-specific default risks; we propose to construct proxy CDS rates by
associating to illiquid counterparty liquid CDS Proxy based on Machine Learning
Techniques. After testing 156 classifiers from 8 most popular classifier
families, we found that some classifiers achieve highly satisfactory accuracy
rates. Furthermore, we have rank-ordered the performances and investigated
performance variations amongst and within the 8 classifier families. This paper
is, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic study of CDS Proxy
construction by Machine Learning techniques, and the first systematic
classifier comparison study based entirely on financial market data. Its
findings both confirm and contrast existing classifier performance literature.
Given the typically highly correlated nature of financial data, we investigated
the impact of correlation on classifier performance. The techniques used in
this paper should be of interest for financial institutions seeking a CDS Proxy
method, and can serve for proxy construction for other financial variables.
Some directions for future research are indicated.

yet incurs no prior training, and is thus suited to both supervised and
unsupervised MIR tasks. The eigenprogression transform combines ideas from the
spiral scattering transform, spectral graph theory, and wavelet shrinkage

21091,A Flux Conserving Meshfree Method for Conservation Laws,"  Lack of conservation has been the biggest drawback in meshfree generalized
finite difference methods (GFDMs). In this paper, we present a novel
modification of classical meshfree GFDMs to include local balances which
produce an approximate conservation of numerical fluxes. This numerical flux
conservation is done within the usual moving least squares framework. Unlike
Finite Volume Methods, it is based on locally defined control cells, rather
than a globally defined mesh. We present the application of this method to an
advection diffusion equation and the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations.
Our simulations show that the introduction of flux conservation significantly
reduces the errors in conservation in meshfree GFDMs.

21092,Anomaly detection in the dynamics of web and social networks,"  In this work, we propose a new, fast and scalable method for anomaly
detection in large time-evolving graphs. It may be a static graph with dynamic
node attributes (e.g. time-series), or a graph evolving in time, such as a
temporal network. We define an anomaly as a localized increase in temporal
activity in a cluster of nodes. The algorithm is unsupervised. It is able to
detect and track anomalous activity in a dynamic network despite the noise from
multiple interfering sources. We use the Hopfield network model of memory to
combine the graph and time information. We show that anomalies can be spotted
with a good precision using a memory network. The presented approach is
scalable and we provide a distributed implementation of the algorithm. To
demonstrate its efficiency, we apply it to two datasets: Enron Email dataset
and Wikipedia page views. We show that the anomalous spikes are triggered by
the real-world events that impact the network dynamics. Besides, the structure
of the clusters and the analysis of the time evolution associated with the
detected events reveals interesting facts on how humans interact, exchange and
search for information, opening the door to new quantitative studies on
collective and social behavior on large and dynamic datasets.

21094,Emission line ratios of Fe III as astrophysical plasma diagnostics,"  Recent state-of-the-art calculations of A-values and electron impact
excitation rates for Fe III are used in conjunction with the Cloudy modeling
code to derive emission line intensity ratios for optical transitions among the
fine-structure levels of the 3d$^6$ configuration. A comparison of these with
high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of gaseous nebulae reveals that
previous discrepancies found between theory and observation are not fully
resolved by the latest atomic data. Blending is ruled out as a likely cause of
the discrepancies, because temperature- and density-independent ratios (arising
from lines with common upper levels) match well with those predicted by theory.
For a typical nebular plasma with electron temperature $T_{\rm e} = 9000$ K and
electron density $\rm N_{e}=10^4 \, cm^{-3}$, cascading of electrons from the
levels $\rm ^3G_5$, $\rm ^3G_4$ and $\rm ^3G_3$ plays an important role in
determining the populations of lower levels, such as $\rm ^3F_4$, which provide
the density diagnostic emission lines of Fe III, such as $\rm ^5D_4$ - $\rm
^3F_4$ at 4658 \AA. Hence further work on the A-values for these transitions is
recommended, ideally including measurements if possible. However, some Fe III
ratios do provide reliable $N_{\rm e}$-diagnostics, such as 4986/4658. The Fe
III cooling function calculated with Cloudy using the most recent atomic data
is found to be significantly greater at $T_e$ $\simeq$ 30000 K than predicted
with the existing Cloudy model. This is due to the presence of additional
emission lines with the new data, particularly in the 1000--4000 \AA\
wavelength region.

21095,"Warped cones, (non-)rigidity, and piecewise properties, with a joint appendix with Dawid Kielak","  We prove that if a quasi-isometry of warped cones is induced by a map between
the base spaces of the cones, the actions must be conjugate by this map. The
converse is false in general, conjugacy of actions is not sufficient for
quasi-isometry of the respective warped cones. For a general quasi-isometry of
warped cones, using the asymptotically faithful covering constructed in a
previous work with Jianchao Wu, we deduce that the two groups are
quasi-isometric after taking Cartesian products with suitable powers of the
integers.
Secondly, we characterise geometric properties of a group (coarse
embeddability into Banach spaces, asymptotic dimension, property A) by
properties of the warped cone over an action of this group. These results apply
to arbitrary asymptotically faithful coverings, in particular to box spaces. As
an application, we calculate the asymptotic dimension of a warped cone, improve
bounds by SzabÃ³, Wu, and Zacharias and by Bartels on the amenability
dimension of actions of virtually nilpotent groups, and give a partial answer
to a question of Willett about dynamic asymptotic dimension.
In the appendix, we justify optimality of the aforementioned result on
general quasi-isometries by showing that quasi-isometric warped cones need not
come from quasi-isometric groups, contrary to the case of box spaces.

21096,Enhancing MapReduce Fault Recovery Through Binocular Speculation,"  MapReduce speculation plays an important role in finding potential task
stragglers and failures. But a tacit dichotomy exists in MapReduce due to its
inherent two-phase (map and reduce) management scheme in which map tasks and
reduce tasks have distinctly different execution behaviors, yet reduce tasks
are dependent on the results of map tasks. We reveal that speculation policies
for fault handling in MapReduce do not recognize this dichotomy between map and
reduce tasks, which leads to an issue of speculation myopia for MapReduce fault
recovery. These issues cause significant performance degradation upon network
and node failures. To address the speculation myopia caused by MapReduce
dichotomy, we introduce a new scheme called binocular speculation to help
MapReduce increase its assessment scope for speculation. As part of the scheme,
we also design three component techniques including neighborhood glance,
collective speculation and speculative rollback. Our evaluation shows that,
with these techniques, binocular speculation can increase the coordination of
map and reduce phases, and enhance the efficiency of MapReduce fault recovery.

21099,Accelerated Optimization in the PDE Framework: Formulations for the Manifold of Diffeomorphisms,"  We consider the problem of optimization of cost functionals on the
infinite-dimensional manifold of diffeomorphisms. We present a new class of
optimization methods, valid for any optimization problem setup on the space of
diffeomorphisms by generalizing Nesterov accelerated optimization to the
manifold of diffeomorphisms. While our framework is general for infinite
dimensional manifolds, we specifically treat the case of diffeomorphisms,
motivated by optical flow problems in computer vision. This is accomplished by
building on a recent variational approach to a general class of accelerated
optimization methods by Wibisono, Wilson and Jordan, which applies in finite
dimensions. We generalize that approach to infinite dimensional manifolds. We
derive the surprisingly simple continuum evolution equations, which are partial
differential equations, for accelerated gradient descent, and relate it to
simple mechanical principles from fluid mechanics. Our approach has natural
connections to the optimal mass transport problem. This is because one can
think of our approach as an evolution of an infinite number of particles
endowed with mass (represented with a mass density) that moves in an energy
landscape. The mass evolves with the optimization variable, and endows the
particles with dynamics. This is different than the finite dimensional case
where only a single particle moves and hence the dynamics does not depend on
the mass. We derive the theory, compute the PDEs for accelerated optimization,
and illustrate the behavior of these new accelerated optimization schemes.

21100,Learning Generalizable Robot Skills from Demonstrations in Cluttered Environments,"  Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach to endowing robots
with skills without having to program them by hand. Typically, LfD relies on
human demonstrations in clutter-free environments. This prevents the
demonstrations from being affected by irrelevant objects, whose influence can
obfuscate the true intention of the human or the constraints of the desired
skill. However, it is unrealistic to assume that the robot's environment can
always be restructured to remove clutter when capturing human demonstrations.
To contend with this problem, we develop an importance weighted batch and
incremental skill learning approach, building on a recent inference-based
technique for skill representation and reproduction. Our approach reduces
unwanted environmental influences on the learned skill, while still capturing
the salient human behavior. We provide both batch and incremental versions of
our approach and validate our algorithms on a 7-DOF JACO2 manipulator with
reaching and placing skills.

Yet, little is known about whether there are gender differences in cooperative

the relaxation times of the TLS Rabi oscillations are derived when the boson
bath is in the normal state and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. We
apply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a
boson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath
is in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both
condensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light
coupling and dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light
coupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the
normal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi
oscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump
field frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath
is in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the
dipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation
rate on both the pump field frequency and field strength, providing a
characteristic signature for the detection of BEC phase transition of the
coupled dipolar exciton gas.

21103,On the approximation of convex bodies by ellipses with respect to the symmetric difference metric,"  Given a centrally symmetric convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a
positive number $\lambda$, we consider, among all ellipsoids $E \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ of volume $\lambda$, those that best approximate $K$ with respect
to the symmetric difference metric, or equivalently that maximize the volume of
$E\cap K$: these are the maximal intersection (MI) ellipsoids introduced by
Artstein-Avidan and Katzin. The question of uniqueness of MI ellipsoids (under
the obviously necessary assumption that $\lambda$ is between the volumes of the
John and the Loewner ellipsoids of $K$) is open in general. We provide a
positive answer to this question in dimension $d=2$. Therefore we obtain a
continuous $1$-parameter family of ellipses interpolating between the John and
the Loewner ellipses of $K$. In order to prove uniqueness, we show that the
area $I_K(E)$ of the intersection $K \cap E$ is a strictly quasiconcave
function of the ellipse $E$, with respect to the natural affine structure on
the set of ellipses of area $\lambda$. The proof relies on smoothening $K$,
putting it in general position, and obtaining uniform estimates for certain
derivatives of the function $I_K(.)$. Finally, we provide a characterization of
maximal intersection positions, that is, the situation where the MI ellipse of
$K$ is the unit disk, under the assumption that the two boundaries are
transverse.

21104,POLAMI: Polarimetric Monitoring of Active Galactic Nuclei at Millimetre Wavelengths. II. Widespread circular polarisation,"  We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of
the POLAMI project introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the
3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one
of our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most
sources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is
broader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)
circular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the
maximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,
all made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating
circular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose
that the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength
sample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly
polarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.
Circular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or
shorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about
one year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the
signal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the
sign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,
including 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees
of circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We
do find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in
synchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel
method for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations.

21105,Single Classifier-based Passive System for Source Printer Classification using Local Texture Features,"  An important aspect of examining printed documents for potential forgeries
and copyright infringement is the identification of source printer as it can be
helpful for ascertaining the leak and detecting forged documents. This paper
proposes a system for classification of source printer from scanned images of
printed documents using all the printed letters simultaneously. This system
uses local texture patterns based features and a single classifier for
classifying all the printed letters. Letters are extracted from scanned images
using connected component analysis followed by morphological filtering without
the need of using an OCR. Each letter is sub-divided into a flat region and an
edge region, and local tetra patterns are estimated separately for these two
regions. A strategically constructed pooling technique is used to extract the
final feature vectors. The proposed method has been tested on both a publicly
available dataset of 10 printers and a new dataset of 18 printers scanned at a
resolution of 600 dpi as well as 300 dpi printed in four different fonts. The
results indicate shape independence property in the proposed method as using a
single classifier it outperforms existing handcrafted feature-based methods and
needs much smaller number of training pages by using all the printed letters.

21106,Heat spreader with parallel microchannel configurations employing nanofluids for near active cooling of MEMS,"  While parallel microchannel based cooling systems have been around for quite
a period of time, employing the same and incorporating them for near active
cooling of microelectronic devices is yet to be implemented and the
implications of the same on thermal mitigation to be understood. The present
article focusses on a specific design of the PMCS such that it can be
implemented at ease on the heat spreader of a modern microprocessor to obtain
near active cooling. Extensive experimental and numerical studies have been
carried out to comprehend the same and three different flow configurations of
PMCS have been adopted for the present investigations. Additional to focussing
on the thermofluidics due to flow configuration, nanofluids have also been
employed to achieve the desired essentials of mitigation of overshoot
temperatures and improving uniformity of cooling. Two modelling methods,
Discrete Phase Modelling and Effective Property Modelling have been employed
for numerical study to model nanofluids as working fluid in micro flow paths
and the DPM predictions have been observed to match accurately with
experiments. To quantify the thermal performance of PMCS, an appropriate Figure
of Merit has been proposed. From the FoM It has been perceived that the Z
configuration employing nanofluid is the best suitable solutions for uniform
thermal loads to achieve uniform cooling as well as reducing maximum
temperature produced with in the device. The present results are very promising
and viable approach for futuristic thermal mitigation of microprocessor
systems.

21108,Multiview Deep Learning for Predicting Twitter Users' Location,"  The problem of predicting the location of users on large social networks like
Twitter has emerged from real-life applications such as social unrest detection
and online marketing. Twitter user geolocation is a difficult and active
research topic with a vast literature. Most of the proposed methods follow
either a content-based or a network-based approach. The former exploits
user-generated content while the latter utilizes the connection or interaction
between Twitter users. In this paper, we introduce a novel method combining the
strength of both approaches. Concretely, we propose a multi-entry neural
network architecture named MENET leveraging the advances in deep learning and
multiview learning. The generalizability of MENET enables the integration of
multiple data representations. In the context of Twitter user geolocation, we
realize MENET with textual, network, and metadata features. Considering the
natural distribution of Twitter users across the concerned geographical area,
we subdivide the surface of the earth into multi-scale cells and train MENET
with the labels of the cells. We show that our method outperforms the state of
the art by a large margin on three benchmark datasets.

21109,"Designing the Optimal Bit: Balancing Energetic Cost, Speed and Reliability","  We consider the technologically relevant costs of operating a reliable bit
that can be erased rapidly. We find that both erasing and reliability times are
non-monotonic in the underlying friction, leading to a trade-off between
erasing speed and bit reliability. Fast erasure is possible at the expense of
low reliability at moderate friction, and high reliability comes at the expense
of slow erasure in the underdamped and overdamped limits. Within a given class
of bit parameters and control strategies, we define ""optimal"" designs of bits
that meet the desired reliability and erasing time requirements with the lowest
operational work cost. We find that optimal designs always saturate the bound
on the erasing time requirement, but can exceed the required reliability time
if critically damped. The non-trivial geometry of the reliability and erasing
time-scales allows us to exclude large regions of parameter space as
sub-optimal. We find that optimal designs are either critically damped or close
to critical damping under the erasing procedure.

21110,Economic Factors of Vulnerability Trade and Exploitation,"  Cybercrime markets support the development and diffusion of new attack
technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. Whereas the revenue streams
of cyber attackers have been studied multiple times in the literature, no
quantitative account currently exists on the economics of attack acquisition
and deployment. Yet, this understanding is critical to characterize the
production of (traded) exploits, the economy that drives it, and its effects on
the overall attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical
investigation of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the effects
of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected
first-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the trading of
the most active attack tools reported by the security industry happens. Our
findings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above
vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle
of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand,
cybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and
the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and
exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on
likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation
between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on
vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.

manifolds containing genus one fibered knots with generalized crossing changes
resulting in another genus one fibered knot, and all generalized crossing
changes between two genus one, fibered knots.

21112,Strain Mode of General Flow: Characterization and Implications for Flow Pattern Structures,"  Understanding the mixing capability of mixing devices based on their
geometric shape is an important issue both for predicting mixing processes and
for designing new mixers. The flow patterns in mixers are directly connected
with the modes of the local strain rate, which is generally a combination of
elongational flow and planar shear flow. We develop a measure to characterize
the modes of the strain rate for general flow occurring in mixers. The spatial
distribution of the volumetric strain rate (or non-planar strain rate) in
connection with the flow pattern plays an essential role in understanding
distributive mixing. With our measure, flows with different types of screw
elements in a twin-screw extruder are numerically analyzed. The difference in
flow pattern structure between conveying screws and kneading disks is
successfully characterized by the distribution of the volumetric strain rate.
The results suggest that the distribution of the strain rate mode offers an
essential and convenient way for characterization of the relation between flow
pattern structure and the mixer geometry.

equivalent to $QGr(R_\Delta)$ where $R_\Delta$ is a diagonal-like

the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-algebras as introduced in [arXiv:1607.08383] are
QGr-equivalent to a diagonal-like sub-$\mathbb{Z}$-algebra which is a
simultaneous noncommutative blow-up of a quadratic and a cubic Sklyanin

associated $\mathbb{Z}^2$-algebras as appearing in the work of Van den Bergh

21114,Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Anomaly Event Classification on Distributed Systems,"  The increasing popularity of server usage has brought a plenty of anomaly log
events, which have threatened a vast collection of machines. Recognizing and

systems, especially the ones generate the massive amount of data and harness it
for technology value creation and business development. To assist in focusing
on the classification and the prediction of anomaly events, and gaining
critical insights from system event records, we propose a novel log
preprocessing method which is very effective to filter abundant information and
retain critical characteristics. Additionally, a competitive approach for
automated classification of anomalous events detected from the distributed

formulation/algorithm for group-sparse block PCA and ii) a framework for the
definition of explained variance with the analysis of five definitions. The
numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over
deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of
group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms
according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition of
explained variance. These results lead to propose a new optimal variance as the

retrieval in signal processing, we develop a simple yet efficient two-stage
algorithm that leverages the multi-frequency information. We demonstrate in
theory and practice that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art phase synchronization algorithms, at a mild computational
costs incurred by using the extra frequency channels. We also extend our

21118,Thermal field theory of bosonic gases with finite-range effective interaction,"  We study a dilute and ultracold Bose gas of interacting atoms by using an
effective field theory which takes account finite-range effects of the
inter-atomic potential. Within the formalism of functional integration from the
grand canonical partition function we derive beyond-mean-field analytical
results which depend on both scattering length and effective range of the
interaction. In particular, we calculate the equation of state of the bosonic
system as a function of these interaction parameters both at zero and finite
temperature including one-loop Gaussian fluctuation. In the case of zero-range
effective interaction we explicitly show that, due to quantum fluctuations, the
bosonic system is thermodynamically stable only for very small values of the
gas parameter. We find that a positive effective range above a critical
threshold is necessary to remove the thermodynamical instability of the uniform
configuration. Remarkably, also for relatively large values of the gas
parameter, our finite-range results are in quite good agreement with recent
zero-temperature Monte Carlo calculations obtained with hard-sphere bosons.

21119,LtFi: Cross-technology Communication for RRM between LTE-U and IEEE 802.11,"  Cross-technology communication (CTC) was proposed in recent literature as a
way to exploit the opportunities of collaboration between heterogeneous
wireless technologies. This paper presents LtFi, a system which enables to
set-up a CTC between nodes of co-located LTE-U and WiFi networks. LtFi follows
a two-step approach: using the air-interface LTE-U BSs are broadcasting
connection and identification data to adjacent WiFi nodes, which is used to
create a bi-directional control channel over the wired Internet. This way LtFi
enables the development of advanced cross-technology interference and radio
resource management schemes between heterogeneous WiFi and LTE-U networks.
LtFi is of low complexity and fully compliant with LTE-U technology and works
on WiFi side with COTS hardware. It was prototypically implemented and
evaluated. Experimental results reveal that LtFi is able to reliably decoded
the data transmitted over the LtFi air-interface in a crowded wireless
environment at even very low LTE-U receive power levels of -92dBm. Moreover,
results from system-level simulations show that LtFi is able to accurately
estimate the set of interfering LTE-U BSs in a typical LTE-U multi-cell
environment.

21120,Multi-step Off-policy Learning Without Importance Sampling Ratios,"  To estimate the value functions of policies from exploratory data, most
model-free off-policy algorithms rely on importance sampling, where the use of
importance sampling ratios often leads to estimates with severe variance. It is
thus desirable to learn off-policy without using the ratios. However, such an
algorithm does not exist for multi-step learning with function approximation.
In this paper, we introduce the first such algorithm based on
temporal-difference (TD) learning updates. We show that an explicit use of
importance sampling ratios can be eliminated by varying the amount of
bootstrapping in TD updates in an action-dependent manner. Our new algorithm
achieves stability using a two-timescale gradient-based TD update. A prior
algorithm based on lookup table representation called Tree Backup can also be
retrieved using action-dependent bootstrapping, becoming a special case of our
algorithm. In two challenging off-policy tasks, we demonstrate that our
algorithm is stable, effectively avoids the large variance issue, and can
perform substantially better than its state-of-the-art counterpart.

21122,On the Limits of Learning Representations with Label-Based Supervision,"  Advances in neural network based classifiers have transformed automatic
feature learning from a pipe dream of stronger AI to a routine and expected
property of practical systems. Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning
submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation
learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning,
representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from
supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as
supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable
representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be
powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned
from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their
supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an
information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for
representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions,
we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for
representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not. We hope that our analysis will
provide a rigorous motivation for further exploration of generative
representation learning.

they ensure self-consistency of a theory by guaranteeing that discrete
symmetries are indeed symmetries of the theory. A generalization of the
developed construction to a special class of symmetry groups with a non-linear
realization of its discrete elements is given. Based on these results, the
usage of the inverse Higgs constraints for the conformal group undergoing
spontaneous symmetry breaking is questioned.

indicate that malaria transmission risk in Greece is potentially substantial.
In addition, specific districts such as seaside, lakeside and rice field

found that appropriate maps depicting the basic reproduction number, R0 , are
useful tools for informing policy makers on the risk of malaria resurgence and
can serve as a guide to inform recommendations regarding control measures.

Internet Services. There exists a body of literature aiming at optimizing ads
engagement, understanding the privacy and ethical implications of online
advertising, etc. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work
analyses at large scale the exposure of real users to online advertising. This
paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the exposure of users to ads and
advertisers using a dataset including more than 7M ads from 140K unique
advertisers delivered to more than 5K users that was collected between October
2016 and May 2018. The study focuses on Facebook, which is the second largest
advertising platform only to Google in terms of revenue, and accounts for more
than 2.2B monthly active users. Our analysis reveals that Facebook users are
exposed (in median) to 70 ads per week, which come from 12 advertisers. Ads
represent between 10% and 15% of all the information received in users'
newsfeed. A small increment of 1% in the portion of ads in the newsfeed could
roughly represent a revenue increase of 8.17M USD per week for Facebook.
Finally, we also reveal that Facebook users are overprofiled since in the best
case only 22.76% of the interests Facebook assigns to users for advertising
purpose are actually related to the ads those users receive.

21126,Concept Formation and Dynamics of Repeated Inference in Deep Generative Models,"  Deep generative models are reported to be useful in broad applications
including image generation. Repeated inference between data space and latent
space in these models can denoise cluttered images and improve the quality of
inferred results. However, previous studies only qualitatively evaluated image
outputs in data space, and the mechanism behind the inference has not been
investigated. The purpose of the current study is to numerically analyze
changes in activity patterns of neurons in the latent space of a deep
generative model called a ""variational auto-encoder"" (VAE). What kinds of
inference dynamics the VAE demonstrates when noise is added to the input data
are identified. The VAE embeds a dataset with clear cluster structures in the
latent space and the center of each cluster of multiple correlated data points
(memories) is referred as the concept. Our study demonstrated that transient
dynamics of inference first approaches a concept, and then moves close to a
memory. Moreover, the VAE revealed that the inference dynamics approaches a
more abstract concept to the extent that the uncertainty of input data
increases due to noise. It was demonstrated that by increasing the number of
the latent variables, the trend of the inference dynamics to approach a concept
can be enhanced, and the generalization ability of the VAE can be improved.

conditions on domains beyond the Lipschitz class. If there is an associated
bounded semigroup on Lp0 , then we prove that the square root extends for all p
$\in$ (p0, 2) to an isomorphism between a closed subspace of W1p carrying the
boundary conditions and Lp. This result is sharp and extrapolates to exponents
slightly above 2. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal p-interval for the
bounded H$\infty$-calculus on Lp. Estimates depend holomorphically on the
coefficients, thereby making them applicable to questions of non-autonomous
maximal regularity and optimal control. For completeness we also provide a
short summary on the Kato square root problem in L2 for systems with lower
order terms in our setting.

are by far the most wide-spread consumers of electricity. Normally the devices
are calibrated to provide the so-called bang-bang control of temperature --
changing from on to off, and vice versa, depending on temperature. Aggregation
of a large group of similar devices into a statistical ensemble is considered,
where the devices operate following the same dynamics subject to stochastic
perturbations and randomized, Poisson on/off switching policy. We analyze,
using theoretical and computational tools of statistical physics, how the
ensemble relaxes to a stationary distribution and establish relation between
the relaxation and statistics of the probability flux, associated with devices'
cycling in the mixed (discrete, switch on/off, and continuous, temperature)
phase space. This allowed us to derive and analyze spectrum of the
non-equilibrium (detailed balance broken) statistical system and uncover how
switching policy affects oscillatory trend and speed of the relaxation.
Relaxation of the ensemble is of a practical interest because it describes how
the ensemble recovers from significant perturbations, e.g. forceful temporary
switching off aimed at utilizing flexibility of the ensemble in providing
""demand response"" services relieving consumption temporarily to balance larger
power grid. We discuss how the statistical analysis can guide further
development of the emerging demand response technology.

21130,Vibrationally resolved electronic spectra including vibrational pre-excitation: Theory and application to VIPER spectroscopy,"  Vibrationally resolved electronic absorption spectra including the effect of
vibrational pre-excitation are computed in order to interpret and predict
vibronic transitions that are probed in the Vibrationally Promoted Electronic
Resonance (VIPER) experiment [L. J. G. W. van Wilderen et al., Angew. Chem.
Int. Ed. 53, 2667 (2014)]. To this end, we employ time-independent and
time-dependent methods based on the evaluation of Franck-Condon overlap
integrals and Fourier transformation of time-domain wavepacket autocorrelation
functions, respectively. The time-independent approach uses a generalized
version of the FCclasses method [F. Santoro et al., J. Chem. Phys. 126, 084509
(2007)]. In the time-dependent approach, autocorrelation functions are obtained
by wavepacket propagation and by evaluation of analytic expressions, within the
harmonic approximation including Duschinsky rotation effects. For several
medium-sized polyatomic systems, it is shown that selective pre-excitation of
particular vibrational modes leads to a red-shift of the low-frequency edge of
the electronic absorption spectrum, which is a prerequisite for the VIPER
experiment. This effect is typically most pronounced upon excitation of ring
distortion modes within an aromatic pi-system. Theoretical predictions as to
which modes show the strongest VIPER effect are found to be in excellent
agreement with experiment.

21131,Modular Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning with Decision Values,"  In this work we present a method for using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) in
multi-objective environments. Deep Q-Networks provide remarkable performance in
single objective problems learning from high-level visual state
representations. However, in many scenarios (e.g in robotics, games), the agent
needs to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously. We propose an architecture
in which separate DQNs are used to control the agent's behaviour with respect
to particular objectives. In this architecture we introduce decision values to
improve the scalarization of multiple DQNs into a single action. Our
architecture enables the decomposition of the agent's behaviour into
controllable and replaceable sub-behaviours learned by distinct modules.
Moreover, it allows to change the priorities of particular objectives
post-learning, while preserving the overall performance of the agent. To
evaluate our solution we used a game-like simulator in which an agent -
provided with high-level visual input - pursues multiple objectives in a 2D
world.

21132,Coupled conditional backward sampling particle filter,"  Unbiased estimation for hidden Markov models has been recently proposed by
Jacob et al (to appear), using a coupling of two conditional particle filters
(CPFs). Unbiased estimation has many advantages, such as enabling the
construction of asymptotically exact confidence intervals and straightforward
parallelisation. In this work we propose a new coupling of two CPFs, for
unbiased estimation, that uses backward sampling steps, which is an important
efficiency enhancing technique in particle filtering. We show that this coupled
conditional backward sampling particle filter (CCBPF) algorithm has better
stability properties, in the sense that with fixed number of particles, the
coupling time in terms of iterations increases only linearly with respect to
the time horizon under a general (strong mixing) condition. In contrast,
current coupled CPFs require the particle number to increase with the horizon
length. An important corollary of our results is a new quantitative bound for
the convergence rate of the popular backward sampling conditional particle
filter. Previous theoretical results have not been able to demonstrate the
improvement brought by backward sampling to the CPF, whereas we provide rates
showing that backward sampling ensures that the CPF can remain effective with a
fixed number of particles independent of the time horizon.

21133,A Bayesian Evidence Synthesis Approach to Estimate Disease Prevalence in Hard-To-Reach Populations: Hepatitis C in New York City,"  Existing methods to estimate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in
New York City (NYC) are limited in scope and fail to assess hard-to-reach
subpopulations with highest risk such as injecting drug users (IDUs). To
address these limitations, we employ a Bayesian multi-parameter evidence
synthesis model to systematically combine multiple sources of data, account for
bias in certain data sources, and provide unbiased HCV prevalence estimates
with associated uncertainty. Our approach improves on previous estimates by
explicitly accounting for injecting drug use and including data from high-risk
subpopulations such as the incarcerated, and is more inclusive, utilizing ten
NYC data sources. In addition, we derive two new equations to allow age at
first injecting drug use data for former and current IDUs to be incorporated
into the Bayesian evidence synthesis, a first for this type of model. Our
estimated overall HCV prevalence as of 2012 among NYC adults aged 20-59 years
is 2.78% (95% CI 2.61-2.94%), which represents between 124,900 and 140,000
chronic HCV cases. These estimates suggest that HCV prevalence in NYC is higher
than previously indicated from household surveys (2.2%) and the surveillance
system (2.37%), and that HCV transmission is increasing among young injecting
adults in NYC. An ancillary benefit from our results is an estimate of current
IDUs aged 20-59 in NYC: 0.58% or 27,600 individuals.

21134,"Galaxies in the Illustris simulation as seen by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - I: Bulge+disc decompositions, methods, and biases","  We present an image-based method for comparing the structural properties of
galaxies produced in hydrodynamical simulations to real galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. The key feature of our work is the introduction of
extensive observational realism, such as object crowding, noise and viewing
angle, to the synthetic images of simulated galaxies, so that they can be
fairly compared to real galaxy catalogs. We apply our methodology to the
dust-free synthetic image catalog of galaxies from the Illustris simulation at
$z=0$, which are then fit with bulge+disc models to obtain morphological
parameters. In this first paper in a series, we detail our methods, quantify
observational biases, and present publicly available bulge+disc decomposition
catalogs. We find that our bulge+disc decompositions are largely robust to the
observational biases that affect decompositions of real galaxies. However, we
identify a significant population of galaxies (roughly 30\% of the full sample)
in Illustris that are prone to internal segmentation, leading to systematically
reduced flux estimates by up to a factor of 6, smaller half-light radii by up
to a factor of $\sim$ 2, and generally erroneous bulge-to-total fractions of
(B/T)=0.

21135,PubTree: A Hierarchical Search Tool for the MEDLINE Database,"  Keeping track of the ever-increasing body of scientific literature is an
escalating challenge. We present PubTree a hierarchical search tool that
efficiently searches the PubMed/MEDLINE dataset based upon a decision tree
constructed using >26 million abstracts. The tool is implemented as a webpage,
where users are asked a series of eighteen questions to locate pertinent
articles. The implementation of this hierarchical search tool highlights issues
endemic with document retrieval. However, the construction of this tree
indicates that with future developments hierarchical search could become an
effective tool (or adjunct) in the mining of biological literature.

21136,Dimensional crossover and incipient quantum size effects in superconducting niobium nanofilms,"  Superconducting and normal state properties of sputtered Niobium nanofilms
have been systematically investigated, as a function of film thickness in a
d=9-90 nm range, on different substrates. The width of the
superconducting-to-normal transition for all films remained in few tens of mK,
thus remarkably narrow, confirming their high quality. We found that the
superconducting critical current density exhibits a pronounced maximum, three
times larger than its bulk value, for film thickness around 25 nm, marking the
3D-to-2D crossover. The extracted magnetic penetration depth shows a sizeable
enhancement for the thinnest films, aside the usual demagnetization effects.
Additional amplification effects of the superconducting properties have been
obtained in the case of sapphire substrates or squeezing the lateral size of
the nanofilms. For thickness close to 20 nm we also measured a doubled
perpendicular critical magnetic field compared to its saturation value for d>33
nm, indicating shortening of the correlation length and the formation of small
Cooper pairs in the condensate. Our data analysis evidences an exciting
interplay between quantum-size and proximity effects together with
strong-coupling effects and importance of disorder in the thinnest films,
locating the ones with optimally enhanced critical properties close to the
BCS-BEC crossover regime.

21137,Phase Diagram of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Generalised Hopfield Networks with Arbitrary Priors,"  Restricted Boltzmann Machines are described by the Gibbs measure of a
bipartite spin glass, which in turn corresponds to the one of a generalised
Hopfield network. This equivalence allows us to characterise the state of these
systems in terms of retrieval capabilities, both at low and high load. We study
the paramagnetic-spin glass and the spin glass-retrieval phase transitions, as
the pattern (i.e. weight) distribution and spin (i.e. unit) priors vary
smoothly from Gaussian real variables to Boolean discrete variables. Our
analysis shows that the presence of a retrieval phase is robust and not
peculiar to the standard Hopfield model with Boolean patterns. The retrieval
region is larger when the pattern entries and retrieval units get more peaked
and, conversely, when the hidden units acquire a broader prior and therefore
have a stronger response to high fields. Moreover, at low load retrieval always
exists below some critical temperature, for every pattern distribution ranging
from the Boolean to the Gaussian case.

21138,Causal nearest neighbor rules for optimal treatment regimes,"  The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to
precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor
method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the
framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects
within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses
nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor
regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor
regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size
increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal
$k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e.
performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this
problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform
metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the
proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a
chronic depression clinical trial.

21139,Definitions of solutions to the IBVP for multiD scalar balance laws,"  We consider four definitions of solution to the initial-boundary value
problem for a scalar balance laws in several space dimensions. These
definitions are generalised to the same most general framework and then
compared. The first aim of this paper is to detail differences and analogies
among them. We focus then on the ways the boundary conditions are fulfilled
according to each definition, providing also connections among these various
modes. The main result is the proof of the equivalence among the presented
definitions of solution.

21140,Post-selection estimation and testing following aggregated association tests,"  The practice of pooling several individual test statistics to form aggregate
tests is common in many statistical application where individual tests may be
underpowered. While selection by aggregate tests can serve to increase power,
the selection process invalidates the individual test-statistics, making it
difficult to identify the ones that drive the signal in follow-up inference.
Here, we develop a general approach for valid inference following selection by
aggregate testing. We present novel powerful post-selection tests for the
individual null hypotheses which are exact for the normal model and
asymptotically justified otherwise. Our approach relies on the ability to
characterize the distribution of the individual test statistics after
conditioning on the event of selection. We provide efficient algorithms for
estimation of the post-selection maximum-likelihood estimates and suggest
confidence intervals which rely on a novel switching regime for good coverage
guarantees. We validate our methods via comprehensive simulation studies and
apply them to data from the Dallas Heart Study, demonstrating that single
variant association discovery following selection by an aggregated test is
indeed possible in practice.

many exciting ways to tackle well known and challenging medical image analysis
problems such as medical image de-noising, reconstruction, segmentation, data
simulation, detection or classification. Furthermore, their ability to
synthesize images at unprecedented levels of realism also gives hope that the
chronic scarcity of labeled data in the medical field can be resolved with the
help of these generative models. In this review paper, a broad overview of
recent literature on GANs for medical applications is given, the shortcomings
and opportunities of the proposed methods are thoroughly discussed and
potential future work is elaborated. We review the most relevant papers
published until the submission date. For quick access, important details such

21142,NFL Injuries Before and After the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA),"  The National Football League's (NFL) 2011 collective bargaining agreement
(CBA) with its players placed a number of contact and quantity limitations on
practices and workouts. Some coaches and others have expressed a concern that
this has led to poor conditioning and a subsequent increase in injuries. We
sought to assess whether the 2011 CBA's practice restrictions affected the
number of overall, conditioning-dependent, and/or non-conditioning-dependent
injuries in the NFL or the number of games missed due to those injuries. The
study population was player-seasons from 2007-2016. We included regular season,
non-illness, non-head, game-loss injuries. Injuries were identified using a
database from Football Outsiders. The primary outcomes were overall,
conditioning-dependent and non-conditioning-dependent injury counts by season.
We examined time trends in injury counts before (2007-2010) and after
(2011-2016) the CBA using a Poisson interrupted time series model. The number
of game-loss regular season, non-head, non-illness injuries grew from 701 in
2007 to 804 in 2016 (15% increase). The number of regular season weeks missed
exhibited a similar increase. Conditioning-dependent injuries increased from
197 in 2007 to 271 in 2011 (38% rise), but were lower and remained relatively
unchanged at 220-240 injuries per season thereafter. Non-conditioning injuries
decreased by 37% in the first three years of the new CBA before returning to
historic levels in 2014-2016. Poisson models for all, conditioning-dependent,
and non-conditioning-dependent game-loss injury counts did not show
statistically significant or meaningful detrimental changes associated with the
CBA. We did not observe an increase in injuries following the 2011 CBA. Other
concurrent injury-related rule and regulation changes limit specific causal
inferences about the practice restrictions, however.

21143,"Structured and Unstructured Outlier Identification for Robust PCA: A Non iterative, Parameter free Algorithm","  Robust PCA, the problem of PCA in the presence of outliers has been
extensively investigated in the last few years. Here we focus on Robust PCA in
the outlier model where each column of the data matrix is either an inlier or
an outlier. Most of the existing methods for this model assumes either the
knowledge of the dimension of the lower dimensional subspace or the fraction of
outliers in the system. However in many applications knowledge of these
parameters is not available. Motivated by this we propose a parameter free
outlier identification method for robust PCA which a) does not require the
knowledge of outlier fraction, b) does not require the knowledge of the
dimension of the underlying subspace, c) is computationally simple and fast d)
can handle structured and unstructured outliers. Further, analytical guarantees
are derived for outlier identification and the performance of the algorithm is
compared with the existing state of the art methods in both real and synthetic
data for various outlier structures.

21144,Foveated Video Streaming for Cloud Gaming,"  Good user experience with interactive cloud-based multimedia applications,
such as cloud gaming and cloud-based VR, requires low end-to-end latency and
large amounts of downstream network bandwidth at the same time. In this paper,
we present a foveated video streaming system for cloud gaming. The system
adapts video stream quality by adjusting the encoding parameters on the fly to
match the player's gaze position. We conduct measurements with a prototype that
we developed for a cloud gaming system in conjunction with eye tracker
hardware. Evaluation results suggest that such foveated streaming can reduce
bandwidth requirements by even more than 50% depending on parametrization of
the foveated video coding and that it is feasible from the latency perspective.

21145,Data-driven Analysis of Complex Networks and their Model-generated Counterparts,"  Data-driven analysis of complex networks has been in the focus of research
for decades. An important question is to discover the relation between various
network characteristics in real-world networks and how these relationships vary
across network domains. A related research question is to study how well the
network models can capture the observed relations between the graph metrics. In
this paper, we apply statistical and machine learning techniques to answer the
aforementioned questions. We study 400 real-world networks along with 2400
networks generated by five frequently used network models with previously
fitted parameters to make the generated graphs as similar to the real network
as possible. We find that the correlation profiles of the structural measures
significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be efficiently
determined using a small selection of graph metrics. The goodness-of-fit of the
network models and the best performing models themselves highly depend on the
domains. Using machine learning techniques, it turned out to be relatively easy
to decide if a network is real or model-generated. We also investigate what
structural properties make it possible to achieve a good accuracy, i.e. what
features the network models cannot capture.

21146,A Short Note on Collecting Dependently Typed Values,"  Within dependently typed languages, such as Idris, types can depend on
values. This dependency, however, can limit the collection of items in standard
containers: all elements must have the same type, and as such their types must
contain the same values. We present two dependently typed data structures for
collecting dependent types: \texttt{DList} and \texttt{PList}. Use of these new
data structures allow for the creation of single succinct inductive ADT whose
constructions were previously verbose and split across many data structures.

21147,Dynamic Bridge-Finding in $\tilde{O}(\log ^2 n)$ Amortized Time,"  We present a deterministic fully-dynamic data structure for maintaining
information about the bridges in a graph. We support updates in
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^2)$ amortized time, and can find a bridge in the component
of any given vertex, or a bridge separating any two given vertices, in $O(\log
n / \log \log n)$ worst case time. Our bounds match the current best for bounds
for deterministic fully-dynamic connectivity up to $\log\log n$ factors. The
previous best dynamic bridge finding was an $\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$ amortized
time algorithm by Thorup [STOC2000], which was a bittrick-based improvement on
the $O((\log n)^4)$ amortized time algorithm by Holm et al.[STOC98, JACM2001].
Our approach is based on a different and purely combinatorial improvement of
the algorithm of Holm et al., which by itself gives a new combinatorial
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$ amortized time algorithm. Combining it with Thorup's
bittrick, we get down to the claimed $\tilde{O}((\log n)^2)$ amortized time.
Essentially the same new trick can be applied to the biconnectivity data
structure from [STOC98, JACM2001], improving the amortized update time to
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$.
We also offer improvements in space. We describe a general trick which
applies to both of our new algorithms, and to the old ones, to get down to
linear space, where the previous best use $O(m + n\log n\log\log n)$. Finally,
we show how to obtain $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ query time, matching the optimal
trade-off between update and query time.
Our result yields an improved running time for deciding whether a unique
perfect matching exists in a static graph.

21148,Decomposition of Uncertainty in Bayesian Deep Learning for Efficient and Risk-sensitive Learning,"  Bayesian neural networks with latent variables are scalable and flexible
probabilistic models: They account for uncertainty in the estimation of the
network weights and, by making use of latent variables, can capture complex
noise patterns in the data. We show how to extract and decompose uncertainty
into epistemic and aleatoric components for decision-making purposes. This
allows us to successfully identify informative points for active learning of
functions with heteroscedastic and bimodal noise. Using the decomposition we
further define a novel risk-sensitive criterion for reinforcement learning to
identify policies that balance expected cost, model-bias and noise aversion.

21149,Standard errors for regression on relational data with exchangeable errors,"  Relational arrays represent interactions or associations between pairs of
actors, often in varied contexts or over time. Such data appear as, for
example, trade flows between countries, financial transactions between
individuals, contact frequencies between school children in classrooms, and
dynamic protein-protein interactions. This paper proposes and evaluates a new
class of parameter standard errors for models that represent elements of a
relational array as a linear function of observable covariates. Uncertainty
estimates for regression coefficients must account for both heterogeneity
across actors and dependence arising from relations involving the same actor.
Existing estimators of parameter standard errors that recognize such relational
dependence rely on estimating extremely complex, heterogeneous structure across
actors. Leveraging an exchangeability assumption, we derive parsimonious
standard error estimators that pool information across actors and are
substantially more accurate than existing estimators in a variety of settings.
This exchangeability assumption is pervasive in network and array models in the
statistics literature, but not previously considered when adjusting for
dependence in a regression setting with relational data. We show that our
estimator is consistent and demonstrate improvements in inference through
simulation and a data set involving international trade.

21150,Calculating normal tissue complication probabilities and probabilities of complication-free tumour control from stochastic models of population dynamics,"  We use a stochastic birth-death model for a population of cells to estimate
the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) under a particular
radiotherapy protocol. We specifically allow for interaction between cells, via
a nonlinear logistic growth model. To capture some of the effects of intrinsic
noise in the population we develop several approximations of NTCP, using
Kramers-Moyal expansion techniques. These approaches provide an approximation
to the first and second moments of a general first-passage time problem in the
limit of large, but finite populations. We use this method to study NTCP in a
simple model of normal cells and in a model of normal and damaged cells. We
also study a combined model of normal tissue cells and tumour cells. Based on
existing methods to calculate tumour control probabilities, and our procedure
to approximate NTCP, we estimate the probability of complication free tumour
control.

21151,Pathwise Derivatives Beyond the Reparameterization Trick,"  We observe that gradients computed via the reparameterization trick are in
direct correspondence with solutions of the transport equation in the formalism
of optimal transport. We use this perspective to compute (approximate) pathwise
gradients for probability distributions not directly amenable to the
reparameterization trick: Gamma, Beta, and Dirichlet. We further observe that
when the reparameterization trick is applied to the Cholesky-factorized
multivariate Normal distribution, the resulting gradients are suboptimal in the
sense of optimal transport. We derive the optimal gradients and show that they
have reduced variance in a Gaussian Process regression task. We demonstrate
with a variety of synthetic experiments and stochastic variational inference
tasks that our pathwise gradients are competitive with other methods.

21152,Network-size independent covering number bounds for deep networks,"  We give a covering number bound for deep learning networks that is

Thus, we can ignore the rotation part of each layer's linear transformation,
and get the covering number bound by concentrating on the scaling part.

efficiently approximating mutual information via the dual representation of
Kullback-Leibler divergence allows us to create an information measure that
quantifies how much information flows between any two neurons of a deep
learning model. To that end, we propose NIF, Neural Information Flow, a new
metric for codifying information flow which exposes the internals of a deep

latter is used in analysis of functions of one variable, definable in the
language of Denef--Pas, to obtain a theorem on existence of the limit, proven
over rank one valued fields in one of our recent papers. This result along with
the technique of fiber shrinking (developed there over rank one valued fields)

complex oxides: perovskites, rutiles, pyrochlores, and cristobalites. Even
though calculation was done only in the parent structure, with no distortions,
we show that $X$ dictates material's true ground state structure. We propose
using Wannier functions to extract concealed variables such as $X$ both for
material structure prediction and for high-throughput approaches.

21156,xUnit: Learning a Spatial Activation Function for Efficient Image Restoration,"  In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) achieved unprecedented
performance in many low-level vision tasks. However, state-of-the-art results
are typically achieved by very deep networks, which can reach tens of layers
with tens of millions of parameters. To make DNNs implementable on platforms
with limited resources, it is necessary to weaken the tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new activation unit,
which is particularly suitable for image restoration problems. In contrast to
the widespread per-pixel activation units, like ReLUs and sigmoids, our unit
implements a learnable nonlinear function with spatial connections. This
enables the net to capture much more complex features, thus requiring a
significantly smaller number of layers in order to reach the same performance.
We illustrate the effectiveness of our units through experiments with
state-of-the-art nets for denoising, de-raining, and super resolution, which
are already considered to be very small. With our approach, we are able to
further reduce these models by nearly 50% without incurring any degradation in
performance.

Detailed analysis of $\sim$66.3 hours of clean data revealed the presence of a

hours of observation from 22 - 27 May, 2012 with a statistical significance of
8.05$\sigma$ indicating that the source has possibly switched over to a
relatively high gamma-ray emission state. We have derived time-averaged
differential energy spectrum of the state in the energy range 850 GeV - 17.24

and UV data collected by $\it{Swift}$-UVOT, and radio data collected by OVRO,

21158,"Sparsity enforcing priors in inverse problems via Normal variance mixtures: model selection, algorithms and applications","  The sparse structure of the solution for an inverse problem can be modelled
using different sparsity enforcing priors when the Bayesian approach is
considered. Analytical expression for the unknowns of the model can be obtained
by building hierarchical models based on sparsity enforcing distributions
expressed via conjugate priors. We consider heavy tailed distributions with
this property: the Student-t distribution, which is expressed as a Normal scale
mixture, with the mixing distribution the Inverse Gamma distribution, the
Laplace distribution, which can also be expressed as a Normal scale mixture,
with the mixing distribution the Exponential distribution or can be expressed
as a Normal inverse scale mixture, with the mixing distribution the Inverse
Gamma distribution, the Hyperbolic distribution, the Variance-Gamma
distribution, the Normal-Inverse Gaussian distribution, all three expressed via
conjugate distributions using the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution. For all
distributions iterative algorithms are derived based on hierarchical models
that account for the uncertainties of the forward model. For estimation,
Maximum A Posterior (MAP) and Posterior Mean (PM) via variational Bayesian
approximation (VBA) are used. The performances of resulting algorithm are
compared in applications in 3D computed tomography (3D-CT) and chronobiology.
Finally, a theoretical study is developed for comparison between sparsity
enforcing algorithms obtained via the Bayesian approach and the sparsity
enforcing algorithms issued from regularization techniques, like LASSO and some
others.

tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Dynamic mode
decomposition is a popular numerical algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis;
however, we often need to prepare nonlinear observables manually according to
the underlying dynamics, which is not always possible since we may not have any
a priori knowledge about them. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven
method for Koopman spectral analysis based on the principle of learning Koopman
invariant subspaces from observed data. To this end, we propose minimization of
the residual sum of squares of linear least-squares regression to estimate a
set of functions that transforms data into a form in which the linear
regression fits well. We introduce an implementation with neural networks and
evaluate performance empirically using nonlinear dynamical systems and
applications.

21161,Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of heterogeneous tissue curvature: A suggestion for role of left atrial appendage in atrial fibrillation,"  Background: The arrhythmogenic role of atrial complex morphology has not yet
been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that bumpy tissue geometry can induce
action potential duration (APD) dispersion and wavebreak in atrial fibrillation
(AF).
Methods and Results: We simulated 2D-bumpy atrial model by varying the degree
of bumpiness, and 3D-left atrial (LA) models integrated by LA computed
tomographic (CT) images taken from 14 patients with persistent AF. We also
analyzed wave-dynamic parameters with bipolar electrograms during AF and
compared them with LA-CT geometry in 30 patients with persistent AF. In
2D-bumpy model, APD dispersion increased (p<0.001) and wavebreak occurred
spontaneously when the surface bumpiness was higher, showing phase
transition-like behavior (p<0.001). Bumpiness gradient 2D-model showed that
spiral wave drifted in the direction of higher bumpiness, and phase singularity
(PS) points were mostly located in areas with higher bumpiness. In 3D-LA model,
PS density was higher in LA appendage (LAA) compared to other LA parts
(p<0.05). In 30 persistent AF patients, the surface bumpiness of LAA was
5.8-times that of other LA parts (p<0.001), and exceeded critical bumpiness to
induce wavebreak. Wave dynamics complexity parameters were consistently
dominant in LAA (p<0.001).
Conclusion: The bumpy tissue geometry promotes APD dispersion, wavebreak, and
spiral wave drift in in silico human atrial tissue, and corresponds to clinical
electro-anatomical maps.

one-dimensional interacting Bose gases, using the self-consistent
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method. In a regime of mesoscopic
particle numbers and moderate contact couplings, it is shown that the
phase-fluctuating condensate is properly described as a fragmented condensate.
In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the amplitude of
phase fluctuations significantly deviates from what is obtained in Bogoliubov
theory. Our results can be verified in currently available experiments. They
therefore provide an opportunity both to experimentally benchmark the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, as well as to directly
observe, for the first time, the quantum many-body phenomenon of fragmentation
in single traps.

21163,Thermoelectric transport parallel to the planes in a multilayered Mott-Hubbard heterostructure,"  We present a theory for charge and heat transport parallel to the interfaces
of a multilayer (ML) in which the interfacing gives rise the redistribution of
the electronic charges. The ensuing electrical field couples self-consistently
to the itinerant electrons, so that the properties of the ML crucially depend
on an interplay between the on-site Coulomb forces and the long range
electrostatic forces. The ML is described by the Falicov-Kimball model and the
self-consistent solution is obtained by iterating simultaneously the DMFT and
the Poisson equations. This yields the reconstructed charge profile, the
electrical potential, the planar density of states, the transport function, and
the transport coefficients of the device.
We find that a heterostructure built of two Mott-Hubbard insulators exhibits,
in a large temperature interval, a linear conductivity and a large
temperature-independent thermopower. The charge and energy currents are
confined to the central part of the ML. Our results indicate that correlated
multilayers have the potential for applications; by tuning the band shift and
the Coulomb correlation on the central planes, we can bring the chemical
potential in the immediate proximity of the Mott-Hubbard gap edge and optimize
the transport properties of the device. In such a heterostructure, a small gate
voltage can easily induce a MI transition. This switching does not involve the
diffusion of electrons over macroscopic distances and it is much faster than in
ordinary semiconductors. Furthermore, the right combination of strongly
correlated materials with small ZT can produce, theoretically at least, a
heterostructure with a large ZT.

extent do device models influence the behaviors of their users? The answer to
this question is critical to almost every stakeholder in the smartphone app
ecosystem, including app store operators, developers, end-users, and network
providers. To approach this question, we collect a longitudinal data set of app

investigating how the choices of device models affect user behaviors such as
the adoption of app stores, app selection and abandonment, data plan usage,
online time length, the tendency to use paid/free apps, and the preferences to
choosing competing apps. Some significant correlations between device models
and app usage are derived, leading to important findings on the various user
behaviors. For example, users owning different device models have a substantial
diversity of selecting competing apps, and users owning lower-end devices spend
more money to purchase apps and spend more time under cellular network.

21167,Robust Sparse Covariance Estimation by Thresholding Tyler's M-Estimator,"  Estimating a high-dimensional sparse covariance matrix from a limited number
of samples is a fundamental problem in contemporary data analysis. Most
proposals to date, however, are not robust to outliers or heavy tails. Towards
bridging this gap, in this work we consider estimating a sparse shape matrix
from $n$ samples following a possibly heavy tailed elliptical distribution. We
propose estimators based on thresholding either Tyler's M-estimator or its
regularized variant. We derive bounds on the difference in spectral norm
between our estimators and the shape matrix in the joint limit as the dimension
$p$ and sample size $n$ tend to infinity with $p/n\to\gamma>0$. These bounds
are minimax rate-optimal. Results on simulated data support our theoretical
analysis.

21168,Human Perceptions of Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making: A Case Study of Criminal Risk Prediction,"  As algorithms are increasingly used to make important decisions that affect
human lives, ranging from social benefit assignment to predicting risk of
criminal recidivism, concerns have been raised about the fairness of
algorithmic decision making. Most prior works on algorithmic fairness
normatively prescribe how fair decisions ought to be made. In contrast, here,
we descriptively survey users for how they perceive and reason about fairness
in algorithmic decision making.
A key contribution of this work is the framework we propose to understand why
people perceive certain features as fair or unfair to be used in algorithms.
Our framework identifies eight properties of features, such as relevance,
volitionality and reliability, as latent considerations that inform people's
moral judgments about the fairness of feature use in decision-making
algorithms. We validate our framework through a series of scenario-based
surveys with 576 people. We find that, based on a person's assessment of the
eight latent properties of a feature in our exemplar scenario, we can
accurately (> 85%) predict if the person will judge the use of the feature as
fair.
Our findings have important implications. At a high-level, we show that
people's unfairness concerns are multi-dimensional and argue that future
studies need to address unfairness concerns beyond discrimination. At a
low-level, we find considerable disagreements in people's fairness judgments.
We identify root causes of the disagreements, and note possible pathways to
resolve them.

design shelf layout of superstores. The layout design problem was tackled by
using a novel chromosome representation which takes many different parameters
to prevent dead-ends and improve shelf visibility into consideration. Results
show that the approach can produce reasonably good layout designs in very short

21171,Stability of receding traveling waves for a fourth order degenerate parabolic free boundary problem,"  Consider the thin-film equation $h_t + \left(h h_{yyy}\right)_y = 0$ with a
zero contact angle at the free boundary, that is, at the triple junction where
liquid, gas, and solid meet. Previous results on stability and well-posedness
of this equation have focused on perturbations of equilibrium-stationary or
self-similar profiles, the latter eventually wetting the whole surface. These
solutions have their counterparts for the second-order porous-medium equation
$h_t - (h^m)_{yy} = 0$, where $m > 1$ is a free parameter. Both porous-medium
and thin-film equation degenerate as $h \searrow 0$, but the porous-medium
equation additionally fulfills a comparison principle while the thin-film
equation does not.
In this note, we consider traveling waves $h = \frac V 6 x^3 + \nu x^2$ for
$x \ge 0$, where $x = y-V t$ and $V, \nu \ge 0$ are free parameters. These
traveling waves are receding and therefore describe de-wetting, a phenomenon
genuinely linked to the fourth-order nature of the thin-film equation and not
encountered in the porous-medium case as it violates the comparison principle.
The linear stability analysis leads to a linear fourth-order
degenerate-parabolic operator for which we prove maximal-regularity estimates
to arbitrary orders of the expansion in $x$ in a right-neighborhood of the
contact line $x = 0$. This leads to a well-posedness and stability result for
the corresponding nonlinear equation. As the linearized evolution has different
scaling as $x \searrow 0$ and $x \to \infty$, the analysis is more intricate
than in related previous works. We anticipate that our approach is a natural
step towards investigating other situations in which the comparison principle
is violated, such as droplet rupture.

21172,Group Importance Sampling for Particle Filtering and MCMC,"  Bayesian methods and their implementations by means of sophisticated Monte
Carlo techniques have become very popular in signal processing over the last
years. Importance Sampling (IS) is a well-known Monte Carlo technique that
approximates integrals involving a posterior distribution by means of weighted
samples. In this work, we study the assignation of a single weighted sample
which compresses the information contained in a population of weighted samples.
Part of the theory that we present as Group Importance Sampling (GIS) has been
employed implicitly in different works in the literature. The provided analysis
yields several theoretical and practical consequences. For instance, we discuss
the application of GIS into the Sequential Importance Resampling framework and
show that Independent Multiple Try Metropolis schemes can be interpreted as a
standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, following the GIS approach. We also
introduce two novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques based on GIS.
The first one, named Group Metropolis Sampling method, produces a Markov chain
of sets of weighted samples. All these sets are then employed for obtaining a
unique global estimator. The second one is the Distributed Particle
Metropolis-Hastings technique, where different parallel particle filters are
jointly used to drive an MCMC algorithm. Different resampled trajectories are
compared and then tested with a proper acceptance probability. The novel
schemes are tested in different numerical experiments such as learning the
hyperparameters of Gaussian Processes, two localization problems in a wireless
sensor network (with synthetic and real data) and the tracking of vegetation
parameters given satellite observations, where they are compared with several
benchmark Monte Carlo techniques. Three illustrative Matlab demos are also
provided.

21173,Double Temporal Sparsity Based Accelerated Reconstruction in Compressed Sensing fMRI,"  A number of reconstruction methods have been proposed recently for
accelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data collection.
However, existing methods suffer with the challenge of greater artifacts at
high acceleration factors. This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI
collection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed
Double Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method with the l1 -l1
norm constraint. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly
evaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data.
Results are presented at various acceleration factors. Quantitative analysis in
terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative
analysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs)
demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the
proposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying
fMRI data. Compared to the existing accelerated fMRI reconstruction methods,
the DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10-12dB in
PSNR with acceleration factors upto 3.5. Simulation results on real data
demonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with
accurate detection of RSNs.

21174,A continuum model for distributions of dislocations incorporating short-range interactions,"  Dislocations are the main carriers of the permanent deformation of crystals.
For simulations of engineering applications, continuum models where material
microstructures are represented by continuous density distributions of
dislocations are preferred. It is challenging to capture in the continuum model
the short-range dislocation interactions, which vanish after the standard
averaging procedure from discrete dislocation models. In this study, we
consider systems of parallel straight dislocation walls and develop continuum
descriptions for the short-range interactions of dislocations by using
asymptotic analysis. The obtained continuum short-range interaction formulas
are incorporated in the continuum model for dislocation dynamics based on a
pair of dislocation density potential functions that represent continuous
distributions of dislocations. This derived continuum model is able to describe
the anisotropic dislocation interaction and motion. Mathematically, these
short-range interaction terms ensure strong stability property of the continuum
model that is possessed by the discrete dislocation dynamics model. The derived
continuum model is validated by comparisons with the discrete dislocation
dynamical simulation results.

of the Ising agents drastically changes the behaviour of the Voter model. The
Voter agents act as a medium, which correlates sparsely dispersed Ising agents,
and the resulting ferromagnetic ordering persists up to a certain temperature.
Upon addition of the Ising agents, a logarithmically slow coarsening of the
Voter model ($d=2$), or its active steady state ($d=3$), change into an
Ising-type power-law coarsening.

21176,A probabilistic data-driven model for planar pushing,"  This paper presents a data-driven approach to model planar pushing
interaction to predict both the most likely outcome of a push and its expected
variability. The learned models rely on a variation of Gaussian processes with
input-dependent noise called Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian processes
(VHGP) that capture the mean and variance of a stochastic function. We show
that we can learn accurate models that outperform analytical models after less
than 100 samples and saturate in performance with less than 1000 samples. We
validate the results against a collected dataset of repeated trajectories, and
use the learned models to study questions such as the nature of the variability
in pushing, and the validity of the quasi-static assumption.

21177,Dual constant-flux energy cascades to both large scales and small scales,"  In this paper, we present an overview of concepts and data concerning inverse
cascades of excitation towards scales larger than the forcing scale in a
variety of contexts, from two-dimensional fluids and wave turbulence, to
geophysical flows in the presence of rotation and stratification. We briefly
discuss the role of anisotropy in the occurrence and properties of such
cascades. We then show that the cascade of some invariant, for example the
total energy, may be transferred through nonlinear interactions to both the
small scales and the large scales, with in each case a constant flux. This is
in contrast to the classical picture, and we illustrate such a dual cascade in
the context of atmospheric and oceanic observations, direct numerical
simulations and modeling. We also show that this dual cascade of total energy
can in fact be decomposed in some cases into separate cascades of the kinetic
and potential energies, provided the Froude and Rossby numbers are small
enough. In all cases, the potential energy flux remains small, of the order of
10% or less relative to the kinetic energy flux. Finally, we demonstrate that,
in the small-scale inertial range, approximate equipartition between potential
and kinetic modes is obtained, leading to an energy ratio close to one, with
strong departure at large scales due to the dominant kinetic energy inverse
cascade and piling-up at the lowest spatial frequency, and at small scales due
to unbalanced dissipation processes, even though the Prandtl number is equal to
one.

21178,Worst-case Optimal Submodular Extensions for Marginal Estimation,"  Submodular extensions of an energy function can be used to efficiently
compute approximate marginals via variational inference. The accuracy of the
marginals depends crucially on the quality of the submodular extension. To
identify the best possible extension, we show an equivalence between the
submodular extensions of the energy and the objective functions of linear
programming (LP) relaxations for the corresponding MAP estimation problem. This
allows us to (i) establish the worst-case optimality of the submodular
extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the worst-case
optimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; and
(iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model
with the help of a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method. Using synthetic
and real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on
the log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message
passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible.
Importantly, unlike TRW, our approach provides the first practical algorithm to
compute an upper bound on the dense CRF model.

21179,Superconducting energy gap in $\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$: Temperature dependence,"  The superconducting energy gap of $\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ has been measured by
tunneling. Despite the fact that the sample was macroscopically single phase
with very sharp superconducting transition $T_c$ at 32~$K$, some of the
measured tunnel junctions made by point contacts between silver tip and single
crystal of $\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ had lower transition at 20~$K$. Local
variation of the potassium concentration as well as oxygen deficiency in $\rm
Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ at the place where the point contact is made can account for
the change of $T_c$. The conductance curves of the tunnel junctions reveal the
BCS behavior with a small broadening of the superconducting-gap structure. A
value of the energy gap scales with $T_c$. The reduced gap amounts to
$2\Delta/kT_c = 4Ã·4.3$ indicating a medium coupling strength. Temperature
dependence of the energy gap follows the BCS prediction.

21182,Arbitrage Opportunities in CDS Term Structure: Theory and Implications for OTC Derivatives,"  Absence-of-Arbitrage (AoA) is the basic assumption underpinning derivatives
pricing theory. As part of the OTC derivatives market, the CDS market not only
provides a vehicle for participants to hedge and speculate on the default risks
of corporate and sovereign entities, it also reveals important market-implied
default-risk information concerning the counterparties with which financial
institutions trade, and for which these financial institutions have to
calculate various valuation adjustments (collectively referred to as XVA) as
part of their pricing and risk management of OTC derivatives, to account for
counterparty default risks. In this study, we derive No-arbitrage conditions
for CDS term structures, first in a positive interest rate environment and then
in an arbitrary one. Using an extensive CDS dataset which covers the 2007-09
financial crisis, we present a catalogue of 2,416 pairs of anomalous CDS
contracts which violate the above conditions. Finally, we show in an example
that such anomalies in the CDS term structure can lead to persistent arbitrage
profits and to nonsensical default probabilities. The paper is a first
systematic study on CDS-term-structure arbitrage providing model-free AoA
conditions supported by ample empirical evidence.

Against end-to-end learning, state representation learning can help learn a
compact, efficient and relevant representation of states that speeds up policy
learning, reducing the number of samples needed, and that is easier to
interpret. We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal

While still within the vacuum environment following MBE growth, $\it in-situ$
low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, and $\it in-situ$ variable
low-temperature reflection high energy electron diffraction are applied,

$\mathrm{\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}-R45^\circ}$ with a transition temperature of
$\sim$ 278 K, respectively. $\it Ex-situ$ temperature dependent measurements
are also performed, including x-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction,
looking at the structural peaks and likewise revealing a first-order structural
transition along both [001] and [111] $\it out-of-plane$ directions, with
transition temperatures of 256 K and 268 K, respectively. Turning to the
magnetic peaks, neutron diffraction confirms a clear magnetic transition from
paramagnetic at room temperature to antiferromagnetic at low temperatures with
a sharp, first-order phase transition and a N$Ã©$el temperature of 270 K or

21189,Consistent feature attribution for tree ensembles,"  Note that a newer expanded version of this paper is now available at:
arXiv:1802.03888
It is critical in many applications to understand what features are important
for a model, and why individual predictions were made. For tree ensemble
methods these questions are usually answered by attributing importance values
to input features, either globally or for a single prediction. Here we show
that current feature attribution methods are inconsistent, which means changing
the model to rely more on a given feature can actually decrease the importance
assigned to that feature. To address this problem we develop fast exact
solutions for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which were recently
shown to be the unique additive feature attribution method based on conditional
expectations that is both consistent and locally accurate. We integrate these
improvements into the latest version of XGBoost, demonstrate the
inconsistencies of current methods, and show how using SHAP values results in
significantly improved supervised clustering performance. Feature importance
values are a key part of understanding widely used models such as gradient
boosting trees and random forests, so improvements to them have broad practical
implications.

alternative viewpoint, one deduces a graphical description in type A,
stratification into closed subvarieties of the same kind, and determination of
the torus-fixed points. Moreover, we explain how these manifolds inherit a

theory of effectivity, we develop computable versions of all the basic concepts

A further advantage is that we also trace events that could not commit. Thus,

21201,Skew Brownian motion with dry friction: The Pugachev-Sveshnikov approach,"  The Caughey-Dieness process, also known as the Brownian motion with two
valued drift, is used in theoretical physics as an advanced model of the
Brownian particle velocity if the resistant force is assumed to be dry
friction. This process also appears in many other fields, such as applied
physics, mechanics, astrophysics, and pure mathematics. In the present paper we
are concerned with a more general process, skew Brownian motion with dry
friction. The probability distribution of the process itself and of its
occupation time on the positive half line are studied. The approach based on
the Pugachev-Sveshnikov equation is used.

21202,Numerical modeling of laser-driven experiments aiming to demonstrate magnetic field amplification via turbulent dynamo,"  The universe is permeated by magnetic fields, with strengths ranging from a
femtogauss in the voids between the filaments of galaxy clusters to several
teragauss in black holes and neutron stars. The standard model behind
cosmological magnetic fields is the nonlinear amplification of seed fields via
turbulent dynamo to the values observed. We have conceived experiments that aim
to demonstrate and study the turbulent dynamo mechanism in the laboratory. Here
we describe the design of these experiments through simulation campaigns using
FLASH, a highly capable radiation magnetohydrodynamics code that we have
developed, and large-scale three-dimensional simulations on the Mira
supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. The simulation results indicate
that the experimental platform may be capable of reaching a turbulent plasma
state and study dynamo amplification. We validate and compare our numerical
results with a small subset of experimental data using synthetic diagnostics.

minimum distance estimation method is extended to the panel data model. Second,
the proposed estimators are more efficient than other existing ones. Simulation
studies compare performance of the proposed estimators with performance of
others and demonstrate some superiority of our estimators.

21204,Towards Proving the Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks,"  Autonomous vehicles are highly complex systems, required to function reliably
in a wide variety of situations. Manually crafting software controllers for
these vehicles is difficult, but there has been some success in using deep
neural networks generated using machine-learning. However, deep neural networks
are opaque to human engineers, rendering their correctness very difficult to
prove manually; and existing automated techniques, which were not designed to
operate on neural networks, fail to scale to large systems. This paper focuses
on proving the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, i.e. proving
that small perturbations to a correctly-classified input to the network cannot
cause it to be misclassified. We describe some of our recent and ongoing work
on verifying the adversarial robustness of networks, and discuss some of the
open questions we have encountered and how they might be addressed.

21205,Deep learning-based numerical methods for high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations and backward stochastic differential equations,"  We propose a new algorithm for solving parabolic partial differential

dimension, by making an analogy between the BSDE and reinforcement learning
with the gradient of the solution playing the role of the policy function, and
the loss function given by the error between the prescribed terminal condition
and the solution of the BSDE. The policy function is then approximated by a
neural network, as is done in deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results
using TensorFlow illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
algorithms for several 100-dimensional nonlinear PDEs from physics and finance
such as the Allen-Cahn equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a
nonlinear pricing model for financial derivatives.

21207,Reconstruction of Galaxy Star Formation Histories through SED Fitting: The Dense Basis Approach,"  We introduce the Dense Basis method for Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)
fitting. It accurately recovers traditional SED parameters, including M$_*$,
SFR and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about
the number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar
mass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using
basis Star Formation Histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit
of mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train
and validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at $z =1$ drawn from
stochastic realisations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological
hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a
sample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at $1<z<1.5$ to illustrate its
capabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six
parametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential,
bessel-exponential, lognormal and gaussian SFHs and reject the traditional
parametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the
bias and scatter of each parametrization. $15\%$ of galaxies in our CANDELS
sample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction
decreasing above $M_*>10^{9.5}M_\odot$. About $40\%$ of the CANDELS galaxies
have SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation. The Dense
Basis method is scalable and offers a general approach to a broad class of
data-science problems.

21208,Two-stage multipolar ordering in Pr(TM)$_2$Al$_{20}$ Kondo materials,"  Among heavy fermion materials, there is a set of rare-earth intermetallics
with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ $4f^2$ moments which exhibit a rich phase diagram
with intertwined quadrupolar orders, superconductivity, and non-Fermi liquid
behavior. However, more subtle broken symmetries such as multipolar orders in
these Kondo materials remain poorly studied. Here, we argue that multi-spin
interactions between local moments beyond the conventional two-spin exchange
must play an important role in Kondo materials near the ordered to heavy Fermi
liquid transition. We show that this drives a plethora of phases with
coexisting multipolar orders and multiple thermal phase transitions, providing
a natural framework for interpreting experiments on the Pr(TM)$_2$Al$_{20}$
class of compounds.

21209,Spin-Momentum Locking in the Near Field of Metal Nanoparticles,"  Light carries both spin and momentum. Spin-orbit interactions of light come
into play at the subwavelength scale of nano-optics and nano-photonics, where
they determine the behaviour of light. These phenomena, in which the spin
affects and controls the spatial degrees of freedom of light, are attracting
rapidly growing interest. Here we present results on the spin-momentum locking
in the near field of metal nanostructures supporting localized surface
resonances. These systems can confine light to very small dimensions below the
diffraction limit, leading to a striking near-field enhancement. In contrast to
the propagating evanescent waves of surface plasmon-polariton modes, the
electromagnetic near-field of localized surface resonances does not exhibit a
definite position-independent momentum or polarization. Our results can be
useful to investigate the spin-orbit interactions of light for complex
evanescent fields. Note that the spin of the incident light can control the
rotation direction of the canonical momentum.

21210,Persistence and extinction for stochastic ecological difference equations with feedbacks,"  Species' densities experience both internal frequency-dependent feedbacks due
to population structure and external feedbacks from abiotic factors. These
feedbacks can determine whether populations persist or go extinct, and may be
subject to stochastic fluctuations. To provide a general mathematical framework
for studying these effects, we develop theorems for stochastic persistence and
exclusion for stochastic ecological difference equations accounting for
feedbacks. Specifically, we use the stochastic analog of average Lyapunov
functions to develop sufficient and necessary conditions for (i) all population
densities spending little time at low densities i.e. stochastic persistence,
and (ii) population trajectories asymptotically approaching the extinction set
with positive probability. For (i) and (ii), respectively, we provide
quantitative estimates on the fraction of time that the system is near the
extinction set, and the probability of asymptotic extinction as a function of
the initial state of the system. Furthermore, in the case of persistence, we
provide lower bounds for the time to escape neighborhoods of the extinction
set. To illustrate the applicability of our results, we analyze models of
evolutionary games, stochastic Lotka-Volterra difference equations, trait
evolution, and spatially structured disease dynamics. Our analysis of these
models demonstrates environmental stochasticity facilitates coexistence in the
hawk-dove game, but inhibits coexistence in the rock-paper-scissors game and
Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. Furthermore, environmental fluctuations
with positive auto-correlations can promote persistence of evolving populations
and disease persistence in patchy landscapes. While these results help close
the gap between persistence theories for deterministic and stochastic systems,
we conclude by highlighting several challenges for future research.

21211,Stochastic reachability of a target tube: Theory and computation,"  Given a discrete-time stochastic system and a time-varying sequence of target
sets, we consider the problem of maximizing the probability of the state
evolving within this tube under bounded control authority. This problem
subsumes existing work on stochastic viability and terminal hitting-time
stochastic reach-avoid problems. Of special interest is the stochastic reach
set, the set of all initial states from which the probability of staying in the
target tube is above a desired threshold. This set provides non-trivial
information about the safety and the performance of the system. In this paper,
we provide sufficient conditions under which the stochastic reach set is
closed, compact, and convex. We also discuss an underapproximative
interpolation technique for stochastic reach sets. Finally, we propose a
scalable, grid-free, and anytime algorithm that computes a polytopic
underapproximation of the stochastic reach set and synthesizes an open-loop
controller using convex optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy and
scalability of our approach over existing techniques using three numerical
simulations --- stochastic viability of a chain of integrators, stochastic
reach-avoid computation for a satellite rendezvous and docking problem, and
stochastic reachability of a target tube for a Dubin's car with a known turning
rate sequence.

21212,Bright soliton to quantum droplet transition in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates,"  Attractive Bose-Einstein condensates can host two types of macroscopic
self-bound states of different nature: bright solitons and quantum liquid
droplets. Here, we investigate the connection between them with a Bose-Bose
mixture confined in an optical waveguide. We develop a simple theoretical model
to show that, depending on atom number and interaction strength, solitons and
droplets can be smoothly connected or remain distinct states coexisting only in
a bi-stable region. We experimentally measure their spin composition, extract
their density for a broad range of parameters and map out the boundary of the
region separating solitons from droplets.

21215,Cooling-Rate Effects in Sodium Silicate Glasses: Bridging the Gap between Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Experiments,"  Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are commonly used to predict the
structure and properties of glasses, they are intrinsically limited to short
time scales, necessitating the use of fast cooling rates. It is therefore
challenging to compare results from MD simulations to experimental results for
glasses cooled on typical laboratory time scales. Based on MD simulations of a
sodium silicate glass with varying cooling rate (from 0.01 to 100 K/ps), here
we show that thermal history primarily affects the medium-range order
structure, while the short-range order is largely unaffected over the range of
cooling rates simulated. This results in a decoupling between the enthalpy and
volume relaxation functions, where the enthalpy quickly plateaus as the cooling
rate decreases, whereas density exhibits a slower relaxation. Finally, we
demonstrate that the outcomes of MD simulations can be meaningfully compared to
experimental values if properly extrapolated to slower cooling rates.

21216,Representation Learning for Scale-free Networks,"  Network embedding aims to learn the low-dimensional representations of
vertexes in a network, while structure and inherent properties of the network
is preserved. Existing network embedding works primarily focus on preserving
the microscopic structure, such as the first- and second-order proximity of
vertexes, while the macroscopic scale-free property is largely ignored.
Scale-free property depicts the fact that vertex degrees follow a heavy-tailed
distribution (i.e., only a few vertexes have high degrees) and is a critical
property of real-world networks, such as social networks. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning representations for scale-free networks. We first
theoretically analyze the difficulty of embedding and reconstructing a
scale-free network in the Euclidean space, by converting our problem to the
sphere packing problem. Then, we propose the ""degree penalty"" principle for
designing scale-free property preserving network embedding algorithm: punishing
the proximity between high-degree vertexes. We introduce two implementations of
our principle by utilizing the spectral techniques and a skip-gram model
respectively. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our algorithms
are able to not only reconstruct heavy-tailed distributed degree distribution,
but also outperform state-of-the-art embedding models in various network mining
tasks, such as vertex classification and link prediction.

of extractive summarizers on the DUC datasets under ROUGE evaluation for both
the single-document and multi-document summarization tasks. Next we define the
concept of compressibility of a document and present a new model of
summarization, which generalizes existing models in the literature and
integrates several dimensions of the summarization, viz., abstractive versus
extractive, single versus multi-document, and syntactic versus semantic.
Finally, we examine some new and existing single-document summarization
algorithms in a single framework and compare with state of the art summarizers
on DUC data.

parametrised by a space $P$ to find the best approximation to some ideal
function $f\colon A \to B$. It does this by taking examples $(a,f(a)) \in
A\times B$, and updating the parameter according to some rule. We define a
category where these update rules may be composed, and show that gradient
descent---with respect to a fixed step size and an error function satisfying a
certain property---defines a monoidal functor from a category of parametrised
functions to this category of update rules. This provides a structural
perspective on backpropagation, as well as a broad generalisation of neural
networks.

21219,Entropic selection of concepts unveils hidden topics in documents corpora,"  The organization and evolution of science has recently become itself an
object of scientific quantitative investigation, thanks to the wealth of
information that can be extracted from scientific documents, such as citations
between papers and co-authorship between researchers. However, only few studies
have focused on the concepts that characterize full documents and that can be
extracted and analyzed, revealing the deeper organization of scientific
knowledge. Unfortunately, several concepts can be so common across documents
that they hinder the emergence of the underlying topical structure of the
document corpus, because they give rise to a large amount of spurious and
trivial relations among documents. To identify and remove common concepts, we
introduce a method to gauge their relevance according to an objective
information-theoretic measure related to the statistics of their occurrence
across the document corpus. After progressively removing concepts that,
according to this metric, can be considered as generic, we find that the topic
organization displays a correspondingly more refined structure.

21220,An Optimal Multi-layer Reinsurance Policy under Conditional Tail Expectation,"  A usual reinsurance policy for insurance companies admits one or two layers
of the payment deductions. Under optimal criterion of minimizing the
conditional tail expectation (CTE) risk measure of the insurer's total risk,
this article generalized an optimal stop-loss reinsurance policy to an optimal
multi-layer reinsurance policy. To achieve such optimal multi-layer reinsurance
policy, this article starts from a given optimal stop-loss reinsurance policy
$f(\cdot).$ In the first step, it cuts down an interval $[0,\infty)$ into two
intervals $[0,M_1)$ and $[M_1,\infty).$ By shifting the origin of Cartesian
coordinate system to $(M_{1},f(M_{1})),$ and showing that under the $CTE$
criteria $f(x)I_{[0, M_1)}(x)+(f(M_1)+f(x-M_1))I_{[M_1,\infty)}(x)$ is, again,
an optimal policy. This extension procedure can be repeated to obtain an
optimal k-layer reinsurance policy. Finally, unknown parameters of the optimal
multi-layer reinsurance policy are estimated using some additional appropriate
criteria. Three simulation-based studies have been conducted to demonstrate:
({\bf 1}) The practical applications of our findings and ({\bf 2}) How one may
employ other appropriate criteria to estimate unknown parameters of an optimal
multi-layer contract. The multi-layer reinsurance policy, similar to the
original stop-loss reinsurance policy is optimal, in a same sense. Moreover it
has some other optimal criteria which the original policy does not have. Under
optimal criterion of minimizing general translative and monotone risk measure
$\rho(\cdot)$ of {\it either} the insurer's total risk {\it or} both the
insurer's and the reinsurer's total risks, this article (in its discussion)
also extends a given optimal reinsurance contract $f(\cdot)$ to a multi-layer
and continuous reinsurance policy.

sets $x_1, \dots, x_N \in [0,1]^d$ whose discrepancy with respect to the
Lebesgue measure is of order at most $(\log N)^{d-1} N^{-1}$. In a more general
setting, the first author proved together with Josef Dick that for any
normalized measure $\mu$ on $[0,1]^d$ there exist points $x_1, \dots, x_N$
whose discrepancy with respect to $\mu$ is of order at most $(\log
N)^{(3d+1)/2} N^{-1}$. The proof used methods from combinatorial mathematics,
and in particular a result of Banaszczyk on balancings of vectors. In the
present note we use a version of the so-called transference principle together
with recent results on the discrepancy of red-blue colorings to show that for
any $\mu$ there even exist points having discrepancy of order at most $(\log
N)^{d-\frac12} N^{-1}$, which is almost as good as the discrepancy bound in the
case of the Lebesgue measure.

21222,HBT+: an improved code for finding subhalos and building merger trees in cosmological simulations,"  Dark matter subhalos are the remnants of (incomplete) halo mergers.
Identifying them and establishing their evolutionary links in the form of
merger trees is one of the most important applications of cosmological
simulations. The Hierachical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code identifies halos as they
form and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting
subhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation
of this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more
physically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+ to cosmological
simulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass
function are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between
the two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive
subhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal
stripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more
concentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos.
Subhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the
masses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This
may explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster
centres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the
peak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and the
merger trees constructed using HBT+ do not suffer from the missing or switched
links that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo
finders. We make the HBT+ code publicly available.

21223,On Statistical Non-Significance,"  Significance tests are probably the most extended form of inference in
empirical research, and significance is often interpreted as providing greater
informational content than non-significance. In this article we show, however,
that rejection of a point null often carries very little information, while
failure to reject may be highly informative. This is particularly true in
empirical contexts where data sets are large and where there are rarely reasons
to put substantial prior probability on a point null. Our results challenge the
usual practice of conferring point null rejections a higher level of scientific
significance than non-rejections. In consequence, we advocate a visible
reporting and discussion of non-significant results in empirical practice.

are individually observed and the rest are observed in aggregate, and Bernoulli

photoion coincidence spectrometry with a VUV synchrotron beamline. The
experimental results of the ionization energy are confronted to calculated ones
obtained from simulations using dedicated electronic structure treatment for
large ionized molecular clusters. Experiment and theory consistently find a
decrease of the ionization energy with cluster size. The inclusion of
temperature effects in the simulations leads to a lowering of this energy and
to a quantitative agreement with the experiment. In the case of pyrene, both
theory and experiment show a discontinuity in the IE trend for the hexamer.

21228,Runaway Feedback Loops in Predictive Policing,"  Predictive policing systems are increasingly used to determine how to
allocate police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime
data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process
is repeated. Such systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to
runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same
neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.
In response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that
proves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits
such problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive
policing system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not
occur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are
quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to
which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between
areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which \emph{reported}
incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and \emph{discovered}
incidents of crime (i.e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched
as a result of the predictive policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while
reported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot
entirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.

then show how our algorithms may be applied to several search games with

can also be used to solve search games, given a best response oracle.

21233,Sulfur Hazes in Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres: Impacts on Reflected Light Spectra,"  Recent work has shown that sulfur hazes may arise in the atmospheres of some
giant exoplanets due to the photolysis of H$_{2}$S. We investigate the impact
such a haze would have on an exoplanet's geometric albedo spectrum and how it
may affect the direct imaging results of WFIRST, a planned NASA space
telescope. For temperate (250 K $<$ T$_{\rm eq}$ $<$ 700 K) Jupiter--mass
planets, photochemical destruction of H$_{2}$S results in the production of
$\sim$1 ppmv of \seight between 100 and 0.1 mbar, which, if cool enough, will
condense to form a haze. Nominal haze masses are found to drastically alter a
planet's geometric albedo spectrum: whereas a clear atmosphere is dark at
wavelengths between 0.5 and 1 $\mu$m due to molecular absorption, the addition
of a sulfur haze boosts the albedo there to $\sim$0.7 due to scattering. Strong
absorption by the haze shortward of 0.4 $\mu$m results in albedos $<$0.1, in
contrast to the high albedos produced by Rayleigh scattering in a clear
atmosphere. As a result, the color of the planet shifts from blue to orange.
The existence of a sulfur haze masks the molecular signatures of methane and
water, thereby complicating the characterization of atmospheric composition.
Detection of such a haze by WFIRST is possible, though discriminating between a
sulfur haze and any other highly reflective, high altitude scatterer will
require observations shortward of 0.4 $\mu$m, which is currently beyond
WFIRST's design.

21234,Real-time fMRI neurofeedback training of the amygdala activity with simultaneous EEG in veterans with combat-related PTSD,"  Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling
neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of
the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback
(rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the
amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion
self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf
of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, n=20)
learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala (LA) using rtfMRI-nf
during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG,
n=11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf
training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI.
PTSD severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).
The EG participants showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings,
including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms.
Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful
reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. During the first
session, fMRI connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this
enhancement significantly and positively correlated with initial CAPS ratings.
Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a
significant positive correlation with the initial CAPS. Reduction in PTSD
severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated
with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC.
Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity has the
potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity
deficiencies specific to PTSD.

21235,Approximations from Anywhere and General Rough Sets,"  Not all approximations arise from information systems. The problem of fitting
approximations, subjected to some rules (and related data), to information
systems in a rough scheme of things is known as the \emph{inverse problem}. The
inverse problem is more general than the duality (or abstract representation)
problems and was introduced by the present author in her earlier papers. From
the practical perspective, a few (as opposed to one) theoretical frameworks may
be suitable for formulating the problem itself. \emph{Granular operator spaces}
have been recently introduced and investigated by the present author in her
recent work in the context of antichain based and dialectical semantics for
general rough sets. The nature of the inverse problem is examined from
number-theoretic and combinatorial perspectives in a higher order variant of
granular operator spaces and some necessary conditions are proved. The results
and the novel approach would be useful in a number of unsupervised and semi
supervised learning contexts and algorithms.

21236,The minimal volume of simplices containing a convex body,"  Let $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ be a convex body with barycenter at the origin.
We show there is a simplex $S \subset K$ having also barycenter at the origin
such that $\left(\frac{vol(S)}{vol(K)}\right)^{1/n} \geq \frac{c}{\sqrt{n}},$
where $c>0$ is an absolute constant. This is achieved using stochastic
geometric techniques. Precisely, if $K$ is in isotropic position, we present a
method to find centered simplices verifying the above bound that works with
very high probability.
As a consequence, we provide correct asymptotic estimates on an old problem
in convex geometry. Namely, we show that the simplex $S_{min}(K)$ of minimal
volume enclosing a given convex body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$, fulfills the
following inequality $$\left(\frac{vol(S_{min}(K))}{vol(K)}\right)^{1/n} \leq d
\sqrt{n},$$ for some absolute constant $d>0$. Up to the constant, the estimate
cannot be lessened.

21237,Socioeconomic bias in influenza surveillance,"  Individuals in low socioeconomic brackets are considered at-risk for
developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than
average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been
attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and
therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate
influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to
accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United
States of America's primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet)
monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to
lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate
internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance
systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak
detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical
framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the
adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google
Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels.
We find that zip codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical
blind-spot for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to
ameliorate.

21238,Java Code Analysis and Transformation into AWS Lambda Functions,"  Software developers are faced with the issue of either adapting their
programming model to the execution model (e.g. cloud platforms) or finding
appropriate tools to adapt the model and code automatically. A recent execution
model which would benefit from automated enablement is Function-as-a-Service.
Automating this process requires a pipeline which includes steps for code
analysis, transformation and deployment. In this paper, we outline the design
and runtime characteristics of Podilizer, a tool which implements the pipeline
specifically for Java source code as input and AWS Lambda as output. We
contribute technical and economic metrics about this concrete 'FaaSification'
process by observing the behaviour of Podilizer with two representative Java
software projects.

polynomial ideals in the univariate difference polynomial ring F{y} to have

criteria lies in the fact that complicated properties about difference
polynomial ideals are reduced to elementary properties of univariate

21240,$p$-Euler equations and $p$-Navier-Stokes equations,"  We propose in this work new systems of equations which we call $p$-Euler
equations and $p$-Navier-Stokes equations. $p$-Euler equations are derived as
the Euler-Lagrange equations for the action represented by the Benamou-Brenier
characterization of Wasserstein-$p$ distances, with incompressibility
constraint. $p$-Euler equations have similar structures with the usual Euler
equations but the `momentum' is the signed ($p-1$)-th power of the velocity. In
the 2D case, the $p$-Euler equations have streamfunction-vorticity formulation,
where the vorticity is given by the $p$-Laplacian of the streamfunction. By
adding diffusion presented by $\gamma$-Laplacian of the velocity, we obtain
what we call $p$-Navier-Stokes equations. If $\gamma=p$, the {\it a priori}
energy estimates for the velocity and momentum have dual symmetries. Using
these energy estimates and a time-shift estimate, we show the global existence
of weak solutions for the $p$-Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$\gamma=p$ and $p\ge d\ge 2$ through a compactness criterion.

21241,Unconventional minimal subtraction and Bogoliubov-Parasyuk-Hepp-Zimmermann: massive scalar theory and critical exponents,"  We introduce a simpler although unconventional minimal subtraction
renormalization procedure in the case of a massive scalar $\lambda \phi^{4}$
theory in Euclidean space using dimensional regularization. We show that this
method is very similar to its counterpart in massless field theory. In
particular, the choice of using the bare mass at higher perturbative order
instead of employing its tree-level counterpart eliminates all tadpole
insertions at that order. As an application, we compute diagrammatically the
critical exponents $\eta$ and $\nu$ at least up to two loops. We perform an
explicit comparison with the Bogoliubov-Parasyuk-Hepp-Zimmermann ($BPHZ$)
method at the same loop order, show that the proposed method requires fewer
diagrams and establish a connection between the two approaches.

21242,A covering theorem for singular measures in the Euclidean space,"  We prove that for any singular measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ it is possible
to cover $\mu$-almost every point with $n$ families of Lipschitz slabs of
arbitrarily small total width. More precisely, up to a rotation, for every
$\delta>0$ there are $n$ countable families of $1$-Lipschitz functions
$\{f_i^1\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}},\ldots, \{f_i^n\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}},$
$f_i^j:\{x_j=0\}\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, and $n$ sequences of
positive real numbers $\{\varepsilon_i^1\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}},\ldots,
\{\varepsilon_i^n\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that, denoting $\hat x_j$ the
orthogonal projection of the point $x$ onto $\{x_j=0\}$ and
$$I_i^j:=\{x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}^n:f_i^j(\hat x_j)-\varepsilon_i^j<
x_j< f_i^j(\hat x_j)+\varepsilon_i^j\},$$ it holds
$\sum_{i,j}\varepsilon_i^j\leq \delta$ and
$\mu(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\bigcup_{i,j}I_i^j)=0.$
We apply this result to show that, if $\mu$ is not absolutely continuous, it
is possible to approximate the identity with a sequence $g_h$ of smooth
equi-Lipschitz maps satisfying
$$\limsup_{h\to\infty}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}{\rm{det}}(\nabla g_h)
d\mu<\mu(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ From this, we deduce a simple proof of the fact that
every top-dimensional Ambrosio-Kirchheim metric current in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a
Federer-Fleming flat chain.

21243,Linear-Time Algorithms for Maximum-Weight Induced Matchings and Minimum Chain Covers in Convex Bipartite Graphs,"  A bipartite graph $G=(U,V,E)$ is convex if the vertices in $V$ can be
linearly ordered such that for each vertex $u\in U$, the neighbors of $u$ are
consecutive in the ordering of $V$. An induced matching $H$ of $G$ is a
matching such that no edge of $E$ connects endpoints of two different edges of
$H$. We show that in a convex bipartite graph with $n$ vertices and $m$
weighted edges, an induced matching of maximum total weight can be computed in
$O(n+m)$ time. An unweighted convex bipartite graph has a representation of
size $O(n)$ that records for each vertex $u\in U$ the first and last neighbor
in the ordering of $V$. Given such a compact representation, we compute an
induced matching of maximum cardinality in $O(n)$ time.
In convex bipartite graphs, maximum-cardinality induced matchings are dual to
minimum chain covers. A chain cover is a covering of the edge set by chain
subgraphs, that is, subgraphs that do not contain induced matchings of more
than one edge. Given a compact representation, we compute a representation of a
minimum chain cover in $O(n)$ time. If no compact representation is given, the
cover can be computed in $O(n+m)$ time.
All of our algorithms achieve optimal running time for the respective problem
and model. Previous algorithms considered only the unweighted case, and the
best algorithm for computing a maximum-cardinality induced matching or a
minimum chain cover in a convex bipartite graph had a running time of $O(n^2)$.

21244,Enhanced steady-state dissolution flux in reactive convective dissolution,"  Chemical reactions can accelerate, slow down or even be at the very origin of
the development of dissolution-driven convection in partially miscible
stratifications, when they impact the density profile in the host fluid phase.
We numerically analyze the dynamics of this reactive convective dissolution in
the fully developed non-linear regime for a phase A dissolving into a host
layer containing a dissolved reactant B. We show that for a general
A+B$\rightarrow$C reaction in solution, the dynamics vary with the Rayleigh
numbers of the chemical species, i.e. with the nature of the chemicals in the
host phase. Depending on whether the reaction slows down, accelerates or is at
the origin of the development of convection, the spatial distributions of
species A, B or C, the dissolution flux and the reaction rate are different. We
show that chemical reactions enhance the steady-state flux as they consume A
and can induce more intense convection than in the absence of reactions. This
result is important in the context of CO$_2$ geological sequestration where
quantifying the storage rate of CO$_2$ dissolving into the host oil or aqueous
phase is crucial to assess the efficiency and the safety of the project.

21245,Vapor Condensed and Supercooled Glassy Nanoclusters,"  We use molecular simulation to study the structural and dynamic properties of
glassy nanoclusters formed both through the direct condensation of the vapor
below the glass transition temperature, without the presence of a substrate,
and \textit{via} the slow supercooling of unsupported liquid nanodroplets. An
analysis of local structure using Voronoi polyhedra shows that the energetic
stability of the clusters is characterized by a large, increasing fraction of
bicapped square antiprism motifs. We also show that nanoclusters with similar
inherent structure energies are structurally similar, independent of their
history, which suggests the supercooled clusters access the same low energy
regions of the potential energy landscape as the vapor condensed clusters
despite their different methods of formation. By measuring the intermediate
scattering function at different radii from the cluster center, we find that
the relaxation dynamics of the clusters are inhomogeneous, with the core
becoming glassy above the glass transition temperature while the surface
remains mobile at low temperatures. This helps the clusters sample the highly
stable, low energy structures on the potential energy surface. Our work
suggests the nanocluster systems are structurally more stable than the
ultra-stable glassy thin films, formed through vapor deposition onto a cold
substrate, but the nanoclusters do not exhibit the superheating effects
characteristic of the ultra-stable glass states.

21247,Autocalibrating and Calibrationless Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Bilinear Inverse Problem,"  Modern reconstruction methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exploit
the spatially varying sensitivity profiles of receive-coil arrays as additional
source of information. This allows to reduce the number of time-consuming
Fourier-encoding steps by undersampling. The receive sensitivities are a priori
unknown and influenced by geometry and electric properties of the (moving)
subject. For optimal results, they need to be estimated jointly with the image
from the same undersampled measurement data. Formulated as an inverse problem,
this leads to a bilinear reconstruction problem related to multi-channel blind
deconvolution. In this work, we will discuss some recently developed approaches
for the solution of this problem.

desired interactions with, and role of, the AI, (2) the AI prompted the level
designers to alter their design practices, and (3) the level designers
perceived the AI as having potential value in their design practice, varying
based on their desired role for the AI.

21249,Approximation Algorithms for Barrier Sweep Coverage,"  Time-varying coverage, namely sweep coverage is a recent development in the
area of wireless sensor networks, where a small number of mobile sensors sweep
or monitor comparatively large number of locations periodically. In this
article we study barrier sweep coverage with mobile sensors where the barrier
is considered as a finite length continuous curve on a plane. The coverage at
every point on the curve is time-variant. We propose an optimal solution for
sweep coverage of a finite length continuous curve. Usually energy source of a
mobile sensor is battery with limited power, so energy restricted sweep
coverage is a challenging problem for long running applications. We propose an
energy restricted sweep coverage problem where every mobile sensors must visit
an energy source frequently to recharge or replace its battery. We propose a
$\frac{13}{3}$-approximation algorithm for this problem. The proposed algorithm
for multiple curves achieves the best possible approximation factor 2 for a
special case. We propose a 5-approximation algorithm for the general problem.
As an application of the barrier sweep coverage problem for a set of line
segments, we formulate a data gathering problem. In this problem a set of
mobile sensors is arbitrarily monitoring the line segments one for each. A set
of data mules periodically collects the monitoring data from the set of mobile
sensors. We prove that finding the minimum number of data mules to collect data
periodically from every mobile sensor is NP-hard and propose a 3-approximation
algorithm to solve it.

21250,Reinforcement Learning via Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks,"  Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the learning of policies for complex
tasks in partially observable environments, without explicitly learning the
underlying model of the tasks. While such model-free methods achieve
considerable performance, they often ignore the structure of task. We present a
natural representation of to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems using
Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), to better exploit this
inherent structure. We define 3 such RCNNs, whose forward passes execute an
efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable
environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Backpropagating
gradients through these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the
Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP,
serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the
proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We
demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of replanning,
learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learnt models to achieve
near-optimal policies.

classification of everyday objects employing these techniques. More
specifically, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of how state-of-the art CNN

Experimental results on three challenging material databases show that the best

21252,Localization of JPEG double compression through multi-domain convolutional neural networks,"  When an attacker wants to falsify an image, in most of cases she/he will

diverse theoretical assumptions but very effective solutions have not been
developed yet. Recently, machine learning based approaches have been started to
appear in the field of image forensics to solve diverse tasks such as
acquisition source identification and forgery detection. In this last case, the
aim ahead would be to get a trained neural network able, given a to-be-checked
image, to reliably localize the forged areas. With this in mind, our paper
proposes a step forward in this direction by analyzing how a single or double
JPEG compression can be revealed and localized using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Different kinds of input to the CNN have been taken into
consideration, and various experiments have been carried out trying also to
evidence potential issues to be further investigated.

avoiding the time-consuming hyper-parameter tuning part and enabling higher

investigated for a standard AlexNet network trained with SGD on the mnist and
cifar10 datasets, with both original and random labels; the bound, the
Lipschitz constants, and the excess risks are all in direct correlation,
suggesting both that SGD selects predictors whose complexity scales with the
difficulty of the learning task, and secondly that the presented bound is
sensitive to this complexity.

21255,Fully Coupled Simulation of Cosmic Reionization. III. Stochastic Early Reionization by the Smallest Galaxies,"  Previously we identified a new class of early galaxy that we estimate
contributes up to 30\% of the ionizing photons responsible for reionization.
These are low mass halos in the range $M_h =10^{6.5}-10^{8} M_{\odot}$ that
have been chemically enriched by supernova ejecta from prior Pop III star
formation. Despite their low star formation rates, these Metal Cooling halos
(MCs) are significant sources of ionizing radiation, especially at the onset of
reionization, due to their high number density and ionizing escape fractions.
Here we present a fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamic simulation of
reionization that includes these MCs as well the more massive hydrogen atomic
line cooling halos. Our method is novel: we perform halo finding inline with
the radiation hydrodynamical simulation, and assign escaping ionizing fluxes to
halos using a probability distribution function (PDF) measured from the
galaxy-resolving Renaissance Simulations. The PDF captures the mass dependence
of the ionizing escape fraction as well as the probability that a halo is
actively forming stars. With MCs, reionization starts earlier than if only
halos of $10^8 M_{\odot}$ and above are included, however the redshift when
reionization completes is only marginally affected as this is driven by more
massive galaxies. Because star formation is intermittent in MCs, the earliest
phase of reionization exhibits a stochastic nature, with small H II regions
forming and recombining. Only later, once halos of mass $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$
and above begin to dominate the ionizing emissivity, does reionization proceed
smoothly in the usual manner deduced from previous studies. This occurs at
$z\approx 10$ in our simulation.

Arabic numerals was collected for training and evaluation of the network. The
dataset consists of spatial and temporal touch data recorded for 80 digits

model was a 2D convolutional neural (ConvNet) network applied to bitmaps of the
glpyhs created by interpolation of the sensed screen touches and its topology
is similar to that of previously published models for offline handwriting
recognition from scanned images. The second model used a 1D ConvNet
architecture but was applied to the sequence of polar vectors connecting the
touch points. The models were found to provide accuracies of 98.50% and 95.86%,
respectively. The second model was much simpler, providing a reduction in the
number of parameters from 1,663,370 to 287,690. The dataset has been made

21257,On Counting Perfect Matchings in General Graphs,"  Counting perfect matchings has played a central role in the theory of
counting problems. The permanent, corresponding to bipartite graphs, was shown
to be #P-complete to compute exactly by Valiant (1979), and a fully polynomial
randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) was presented by Jerrum, Sinclair, and
Vigoda (2004) using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. However, it has
remained an open question whether there exists an FPRAS for counting perfect
matchings in general graphs. In fact, it was unresolved whether the same Markov
chain defined by JSV is rapidly mixing in general. In this paper, we show that
it is not. We prove torpid mixing for any weighting scheme on hole patterns in
the JSV chain. As a first step toward overcoming this obstacle, we introduce a
new algorithm for counting matchings based on the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition
of a graph, and give an FPRAS for counting matchings in graphs that are
sufficiently close to bipartite. In particular, we obtain a fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm for counting matchings in general graphs, parameterized by
the greatest ""order"" of a factor-critical subgraph.

21258,Density and spin modes in imbalanced normal Fermi gases from collisionless to hydrodynamic regime,"  We study mass and population imbalance effect on density (in-phase) and spin
(out-of-phase) collective modes in a two-component normal Fermi gas. By
calculating eigenmodes of the linearized Boltzmann equation as well as the
density/spin dynamic structure factor, we show that mass and population
imbalance effects offer a variety of collective mode crossover behaviors from
collisionless to hydrodynamic regimes. The mass imbalance effect shifts the
crossover regime to the higher-temperature, and a significant peak of the spin
dynamic structure factor emerges only in the collisionless regime. This is in
contrast to the case of mass and population balanced normal Fermi gases, where
the spin dynamic response is always absent. Although the population imbalance
effect does not shift the crossover regime, the spin dynamic structure factor
survives both in the collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes.

21259,Bounds on parameters of minimally non-linear patterns,"  Let $ex(n, P)$ be the maximum possible number of ones in any 0-1 matrix of

non-linear if $ex(n, P) = \omega(n)$ but $ex(n, P') = O(n)$ for every strict
subpattern $P'$ of $P$. We prove that the ratio between the length and width of
any minimally non-linear 0-1 matrix is at most $4$, and that a minimally
non-linear 0-1 matrix with $k$ rows has at most $5k-3$ ones. We also obtain an
upper bound on the number of minimally non-linear 0-1 matrices with $k$ rows.
In addition, we prove corresponding bounds for minimally non-linear ordered
graphs. The minimal non-linearity that we investigate for ordered graphs is for
the extremal function $ex_{<}(n, G)$, which is the maximum possible number of
edges in any ordered graph on $n$ vertices with no ordered subgraph isomorphic

Lyrae type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode, that are located in the
Galactic bulge. A~comprehensive overview about the incidence rate and
light-curve characteristics of the Blazhko stars is given. We analysed 8\,282
stars having the best quality data in the OGLE-IV survey, and found that at
least $40.3$\,\% of stars show modulation of their light curves. The number of
Blazhko stars we identified is 3\,341, which is the largest sample ever studied
implying the most relevant statistical results currently available. Using
combined data sets with OGLE-III observations, we found that 50\,\% of stars
that show unresolved close peaks to the main component in OGLE-IV are actually
Blazhko stars with extremely long periods. Blazhko stars with modulation occur
preferentially among RR Lyrae stars with shorter pulsation periods in the
Galactic bulge. Fourier amplitude and phase coefficients based on the mean
light curves appear to be substantially lower for Blazhko stars than for stars
with unmodulated light curve in average. We derived new relations for the
compatibility parameter $D_{m}$ in $I$ passband and relations that allow for
differentiating modulated and non-modulated stars easily on the basis of
$R_{31}$, $\phi_{21}$ and $\phi_{31}$. Photometric metallicities, intrinsic
colours and absolute magnitudes computed using empirical relations are the same
for Blazhko and non-modulated stars in the Galactic bulge suggesting no
correlation between the occurrence of the Blazhko effect and these parameters.

do not necessarily return a maximum assortative graph, even though it is known

as the excited and metastable states in EIT, respectively. Their energy
difference determined by the distance between the atoms can be measured by the
EIT spectra, which renders this method useful in subwavelength metrology. The

spectrum to be recorded at the same time. The single photon analysis is used to
significantly reduce the background noise. Theoretical performance of various

21266,Assessing the impact of non-vaccinators: quantifying the average length of infection chains in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease,"  Analytical expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, have been
obtained in the past for a wide variety of mathematical models for infectious
disease spread, along with expressions for the expected final size of an
outbreak. However, what has so far not been studied is the average number of
infections that descend down the chains of infection begun by each of the
individuals infected in an outbreak (we refer to this quantity as the ""average
number of descendant infections"" per infectious individual, or ANDI). ANDI
includes not only the number of people that an individual directly contacts and
infects, but also the number of people that those go on to infect, and so on
until that particular chain of infection dies out. Quantification of ANDI has
relevance to the vaccination debate, since with ANDI one can calculate the
probability that one or more people are hospitalised (or die) from a disease
down an average chain of infection descending from an infected un-vaccinated
individual. Here we obtain estimates of ANDI using both deterministic and
stochastic modelling formalisms. With both formalisms we find that even for
relatively small community sizes and under most scenarios for R0 and initial
fraction vaccinated, ANDI can be surprisingly large when the effective
reproduction number is >1, leading to high probabilities of adverse outcomes
for one or more people down an average chain of infection in outbreaks of
diseases like measles.

21267,A Framework and Comparative Analysis of Control Plane Security of SDN and Conventional Networks,"  Software defined networking implements the network control plane in an
external entity, rather than in each individual device as in conventional
networks. This architectural difference implies a different design for control
functions necessary for essential network properties, e.g., loop prevention and
link redundancy. We explore how such differences redefine the security
weaknesses in the SDN control plane and provide a framework for comparative
analysis which focuses on essential network properties required by typical
production networks. This enables analysis of how these properties are
delivered by the control planes of SDN and conventional networks, and to
compare security risks and mitigations. Despite the architectural difference,
we find similar, but not identical, exposures in control plane security if both
network paradigms provide the same network properties and are analyzed under
the same threat model. However, defenses vary; SDN cannot depend on edge based
filtering to protect its control plane, while this is arguably the primary
defense in conventional networks. Our concrete security analysis suggests that
a distributed SDN architecture that supports fault tolerance and consistency
checks is important for SDN control plane security. Our analysis methodology
may be of independent interest for future security analysis of SDN and
conventional networks.

21268,Relative homological algebra via truncations,"  To do homological algebra with unbounded chain complexes one needs to first
find a way of constructing resolutions. Spaltenstein solved this problem for
chain complexes of R-modules by truncating further and further to the left,
resolving the pieces, and gluing back the partial resolutions. Our aim is to
give a homotopy theoretical interpretation of this procedure, which may be
extended to a relative setting. We work in an arbitrary abelian category A and
fix a class I of ""injective objects"". We show that Spaltenstein's construction
can be captured by a pair of adjoint functors between unbounded chain complexes
and towers of non-positively graded ones. This pair of adjoint functors forms
what we call a Quillen pair and the above process of truncations, partial
resolutions, and gluing, gives a meaningful way to resolve complexes in a
relative setting up to a split error term. In order to do homotopy theory, and
in particular to construct a well behaved relative derived category D(A; I), we
need more: the split error term must vanish. This is the case when I is the
class of all injective R-modules but not in general, not even for certain
classes of injectives modules over a Noetherian ring. The key property is a
relative analogue of Roos's AB4*-n axiom for abelian categories. Various
concrete examples such as Gorenstein homological algebra and purity are also
discussed.

21270,Model selection and model averaging in MACML-estimated MNP models,"  This paper provides a review of model selection and model averaging methods
for multinomial probit models estimated using the MACML approach. The proposed
approaches are partitioned into test based methods (mostly derived from the
likelihood ratio paradigm), methods based on information criteria and model
averaging methods.
Many of the approaches first have been derived for models estimated using
maximum likelihood and later adapted to the composite marginal likelihood
framework. In this paper all approaches are applied to the MACML approach for
estimation. The investigation lists advantages and disadvantages of the various
methods in terms of asymptotic properties as well as computational aspects. We
find that likelihood-ratio-type tests and information criteria have a spotty
performance when applied to MACML models and instead propose the use of an
empirical likelihood test.
Furthermore, we show that model averaging is easily adaptable to CML
estimation and has promising performance w.r.t to parameter recovery. Finally
model averaging is applied to a real world example in order to demonstrate the
feasibility of the method in real world sized problems.

21271,Fuzzy Ontology-Based Sentiment Analysis of Transportation and City Feature Reviews for Safe Traveling,"  Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly in mega
cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems to address this
problem. However, these techniques are not suitable enough in terms of
monitoring an entire transportation system and delivering emergency services
when needed. These techniques require real-time data and intelligent ways to
quickly determine traffic activity from useful information. In addition, these
existing systems and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating
scores for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness, etc.).
These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise information,
whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they help travelers and
transportation administrators to know about each aspect of the city. However,
it is difficult for travelers to read, and for transportation systems to
process, all reviews and tweets to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the
needs of the city. The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing
the information available on social network platforms and performing sentiment
analysis. On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract
blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce inadequate
results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based sentiment
analysis and SWRL rule-based decision-making to monitor transportation
activities and to make a city- feature polarity map for travelers. This system
retrieves reviews and tweets related to city features and transportation
activities. The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and
then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature
polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are developed by
using ProtÃ©gÃ© OWL and Java, respectively.

21272,On the Gap Between Strict-Saddles and True Convexity: An Omega(log d) Lower Bound for Eigenvector Approximation,"  We prove a \emph{query complexity} lower bound on rank-one principal
component analysis (PCA). We consider an oracle model where, given a symmetric
matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, an algorithm is allowed to make $T$
\emph{exact} queries of the form $w^{(i)} = Mv^{(i)}$ for $i \in
\{1,\dots,T\}$, where $v^{(i)}$ is drawn from a distribution which depends
arbitrarily on the past queries and measurements $\{v^{(j)},w^{(j)}\}_{1 \le j
\le i-1}$. We show that for a small constant $\epsilon$, any adaptive,
randomized algorithm which can find a unit vector $\widehat{v}$ for which
$\widehat{v}^{\top}M\widehat{v} \ge (1-\epsilon)\|M\|$, with even small
probability, must make $T = \Omega(\log d)$ queries. In addition to settling a
widely-held folk conjecture, this bound demonstrates a fundamental gap between
convex optimization and ""strict-saddle"" non-convex optimization of which PCA is
a canonical example: in the former, first-order methods can have dimension-free
iteration complexity, whereas in PCA, the iteration complexity of
gradient-based methods must necessarily grow with the dimension. Our argument
proceeds via a reduction to estimating the rank-one spike in a deformed Wigner
model. We establish lower bounds for this model by developing a ""truncated""
analogue of the $\chi^2$ Bayes-risk lower bound of Chen et al.

21273,A Predictive Approach Using Deep Feature Learning for Electronic Medical Records: A Comparative Study,"  Massive amount of electronic medical records accumulating from patients and
populations motivates clinicians and data scientists to collaborate for the
advanced analytics to extract knowledge that is essential to address the
extensive personalized insights needed for patients, clinicians, providers,
scientists, and health policy makers. In this paper, we propose a new
predictive approach based on feature representation using deep feature learning
and word embedding techniques. Our method uses different deep architectures for
feature representation in higher-level abstraction to obtain effective and more
robust features from EMRs, and then build prediction models on the top of them.
Our approach is particularly useful when the unlabeled data is abundant whereas
labeled one is scarce. We investigate the performance of representation
learning through a supervised approach. First, we apply our method on a small
dataset related to a specific precision medicine problem, which focuses on
prediction of left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVMI) as an
indicator of heart damage risk in a vulnerable demographic subgroup
(African-Americans). Then we use two large datasets from eICU collaborative
research database to predict the length of stay in Cardiac-ICU and Neuro-ICU
based on high dimensional features. Finally we provide a comparative study and
show that our predictive approach leads to better results in comparison with
others.

21274,Gelfand numbers related to structured sparsity and Besov space embeddings with small mixed smoothness,"  We consider the problem of determining the asymptotic order of the Gelfand
numbers of mixed-(quasi-)norm embeddings $\ell^b_p(\ell^d_q) \hookrightarrow
\ell^b_r(\ell^d_u)$ given that $p \leq r$ and $q \leq u$, with emphasis on
cases with $p\leq 1$ and/or $q\leq 1$. These cases turn out to be related to
structured sparsity. We obtain sharp bounds in a number of interesting
parameter constellations. Our new matching bounds for the Gelfand numbers of
the embeddings of $\ell_1^b(\ell_2^d)$ and $\ell_2^b(\ell_1^d)$ into
$\ell_2^b(\ell_2^d)$ imply optimality assertions for the recovery of
block-sparse and sparse-in-levels vectors, respectively. In addition, we apply
the sharp estimates for $\ell^b_p(\ell^d_q)$-spaces to obtain new two-sided
estimates for the Gelfand numbers of multivariate Besov space embeddings in
regimes of small mixed smoothness. It turns out that in some particular cases
these estimates show the same asymptotic behaviour as in the univariate
situation. In the remaining cases they differ at most by a $\log\log$ factor
from the univariate bound.

21275,"Dust attenuation, bulge formation and inside-out cessation of star-formation in Star-Forming Main Sequence galaxies at z~2","  We derive two-dimensional dust attenuation maps at $\sim1~\mathrm{kpc}$
resolution from the UV continuum for ten galaxies on the $z\sim2$ Star-Forming
Main Sequence (SFMS). Comparison with IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies
do not require further obscuration in addition to the UV-based correction,
though our sample does not include the most heavily obscured, massive galaxies.
The individual rest-frame $V$-band dust attenuation (A$_{\rm V}$) radial
profiles scatter around an average profile that gently decreases from $\sim1.8$
mag in the center down to $\sim0.6$ mag at $\sim3-4$ half-mass radii. We use
these maps to correct UV- and H$\alpha$-based star-formation rates (SFRs),
which agree with each other. At masses $<10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the
dust-corrected specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at
a mass-doubling timescale of $\sim300~\mathrm{Myr}$, pointing at a synchronous
growth of bulge and disk components. At masses $>10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the sSFR
profiles are typically centrally-suppressed by a factor of $\sim10$ relative to
the galaxy outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates
that at least a fraction of massive $z\sim2$ SFMS galaxies have started their
inside-out star-formation quenching that will move them to the quenched
sequence. In combination with other observations, galaxies above and below the
ridge of the SFMS relation have respectively centrally-enhanced and
centrally-suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture
where bulges are built due to gas `compaction' that leads to a high central SFR
as galaxies move towards the upper envelope of SFMS.

has been proven to be effective in many fields such as communications. Renyi
entropy and Chernoff information are other two popular measures of information
with wide applications. The mutual information is effective to measure the
channel information for the fact that it reflects the relation between output
variables and input variables. In this paper, we reexamine these channel
information measures in big data viewpoint by means of ACE algorithm. The
simulated results show us that decomposition results of Shannon and Chernoff
mutual information with respect to channel parametersare almost the same. In
this sense, Shannon shakes hands with Chernoff since they are different
measures of the same information quantity. We also propose a conjecture that
there is nature of channel information which is only decided by the channel

21278,SoAx: A generic C++ Structure of Arrays for handling Particles in HPC Codes,"  The numerical study of physical problems often require integrating the
dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of
equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying
such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two
different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing
(HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of
the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information
is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure)
represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In
contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure
holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of
the whole set of particles.
The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and
flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance
of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our
particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon
processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the
AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor
of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and
multi-purpose GPUs.
Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has
optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same
handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such
template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user
defined heterogeneous data structures.

included experiments for different scenarios, research towards combining data
of different scenarios or creating a single model for multiple scenarios have

at the core of the programmatic advertising industry. Two separated lines of
previous works respectively address i) the prediction of user conversion
probability and ii) the attribution of these conversions to advertising events
(such as clicks) after the fact. We argue that attribution modeling improves
the efficiency of the bidding policy in the context of performance advertising.
Firstly we explain the inefficiency of the standard bidding policy with respect
to attribution. Secondly we learn and utilize an attribution model in the
bidder itself and show how it modifies the average bid after a click. Finally
we produce evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method on both offline
and online experiments with data spanning several weeks of real traffic from
Criteo, a leader in performance advertising.

21282,Identifying high betweenness centrality nodes in large social networks,"  This paper proposes an alternative way to identify nodes with high
betweenness centrality. It introduces a new metric, k-path centrality, and a
randomized algorithm for estimating it, and shows empirically that nodes with
high k-path centrality have high node betweenness centrality. The randomized
algorithm runs in time $O(\kappa^{3}n^{2-2\alpha}\log n)$ and outputs, for each
vertex v, an estimate of its k-path centrality up to additive error of $\pm
n^{1/2+ \alpha}$ with probability $1-1/n^2$. Experimental evaluations on real

betweenness centrality nodes and significantly reduced execution time when
compared with existing randomized algorithms.

21283,A functional limit theorem for the sine-process,"  The main result of this paper is a functional limit theorem for the
sine-process. In particular, we study the limit distribution, in the space of
trajectories, for the number of particles in a growing interval. The
sine-process has the Kolmogorov property and satisfies the Central Limit
Theorem, but our functional limit theorem is very different from the Donsker
Invariance Principle. We show that the time integral of our process can be
approximated by the sum of a linear Gaussian process and independent Gaussian
fluctuations whose covariance matrix is computed explicitly. We interpret these
results in terms of the Gaussian Free Field convergence for the random matrix
models. The proof relies on a general form of the multidimensional Central
Limit Theorem under the sine-process for linear statistics of two types: those
having growing variance and those with bounded variance corresponding to
observables of Sobolev regularity $1/2$.

tessellate time into intervals indexed by $\tau$. Given a local event
$E(i,\tau)$ that depends only on the particles inside the space time region
given by the cube $i$ and the time interval $\tau$, we prove the existence of a
Lipschitz connected surface of cells $(i,\tau)$ that separates the origin from
infinity on which $E(i,\tau)$ holds. This gives a directly applicable and
robust framework for proving results in this setting that need a multi-scale
argument. For example, this allows us to prove that an infection spreads with
positive speed among the particles.

21285,The Planck numbers and the essence of gravitation: phenomenology,"  We introduce phenomenological understanding of the electromagnetic component
of the physical vacuum, the EM vacuum, as a basic medium for all masses of the
expanding Universe, and ""Casimir polarization"" of this medium arising in the
vicinity of any material object in the Universe as a result of conjugation of
the electric field components of the EM vacuum on both sides (""external"" and
""internal"") of atomic nucleus boundary of the each mass with vacuum. It is
shown that the gravitational attraction of two material objects in accordance
with Newton's law of gravity arises as a result of overlapping of the domains
of the EM vacuum Casimir polarization created by atomic nuclei of the objects,
taking into account the long-range gravitational influence of all masses of the
Universe on each nucleus of these objects (Mach's idea). Newton's law of
gravitational attraction between two bodies is generalized to the case of
gravitational interaction of a system of bodies when the center of mass of the
pair of bodies shifted relative to the center of mass of the system. The unique
smallness of gravitational interactions as compared with the fundamental
nuclear (strong and weak) and electromagnetic ones is determined by the ratio
of the characteristic size of the domain of EM vacuum Casimir polarization in
the vicinity of atomic nuclei to the Hubble radius of the Universe.

21286,Low-Dimensional Spatial Embedding Method for Shape Uncertainty Quantification in Acoustic Scattering,"  This paper introduces a novel boundary integral approach of shape uncertainty
quantification for the Helmholtz scattering problem in the framework of the
so-called parametric method. The key idea is to construct an integration grid
whose associated weight function encompasses the irregularities and
nonsmoothness imposed by the random boundary. Thus, the solution can be
evaluated accurately with relatively low number of grid points. The integration
grid is obtained by employing a low-dimensional spatial embedding using the
coarea formula. The proposed method can handle large variation as well as
non-smoothness of the random boundary. For the ease of presentation the theory
is restricted to star-shaped obstacles in low-dimensional setting. Higher
spatial and parametric dimensional cases are discussed, though, not extensively
explored in the current study.

21287,Updates on the background estimates for the X-IFU instrument onboard of the ATHENA mission,"  ATHENA, with a launch foreseen in 2028 towards the L2 orbit, addresses the
science theme ""The Hot and Energetic Universe"", coupling a high-performance
X-ray Telescope with two complementary focal-plane instruments. One of these,
the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is a TES based kilo-pixel array providing
spatially resolved high-resolution spectroscopy (2.5 eV at 6 keV) over a 5
arcmin FoV. The background for this kind of detectors accounts for several
components: the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background, the low energy particles
(<~100 keV) focalized by the mirrors and reaching the detector from inside the
field of view, and the high energy particles (>~100 MeV) crossing the
spacecraft and reaching the focal plane from every direction. Each one of these
components is under study to reduce their impact on the instrumental
performances. This task is particularly challenging, given the lack of data on
the background of X-ray detectors in L2, the uncertainties on the particle
environment to be expected in such orbit, and the reliability of the models
used in the Monte Carlo background computations. As a consequence, the
activities addressed by the group range from the reanalysis of the data of
previous missions like XMM-Newton, to the characterization of the L2
environment by data analysis of the particle monitors onboard of satellites
present in the Earth magnetotail, to the characterization of solar events and
their occurrence, and to the validation of the physical models involved in the
Monte Carlo simulations. All these activities will allow to develop a set of
reliable simulations to predict, analyze and find effective solutions to reduce
the particle background experienced by the X-IFU, ultimately satisfying the
scientific requirement that enables the science of ATHENA. While the activities
are still ongoing, we present here some preliminary results already obtained by
the group.

21288,Galaxy Zoo: star-formation versus spiral arm number,"  Spiral arms are common features in low-redshift disc galaxies, and are
prominent sites of star-formation and dust obscuration. However, spiral
structure can take many forms: from galaxies displaying two strong `grand
design' arms, to those with many `flocculent' arms. We investigate how these
different arm types are related to a galaxy's star-formation and gas properties
by making use of visual spiral arm number measurements from Galaxy Zoo 2. We
combine UV and mid-IR photometry from GALEX and WISE to measure the rates and
relative fractions of obscured and unobscured star formation in a sample of
low-redshift SDSS spirals. Total star formation rate has little dependence on
spiral arm multiplicity, but two-armed spirals convert their gas to stars more
efficiently. We find significant differences in the fraction of obscured
star-formation: an additional $\sim 10$ per cent of star-formation in two-armed
galaxies is identified via mid-IR dust emission, compared to that in many-armed
galaxies. The latter are also significantly offset below the IRX-$\beta$
relation for low-redshift star-forming galaxies. We present several
explanations for these differences versus arm number: variations in the spatial
distribution, sizes or clearing timescales of star-forming regions (i.e.,
molecular clouds), or contrasting recent star-formation histories.

21289,Dense Associative Memory is Robust to Adversarial Inputs,"  Deep neural networks (DNN) trained in a supervised way suffer from two known
problems. First, the minima of the objective function used in learning
correspond to data points (also known as rubbish examples or fooling images)
that lack semantic similarity with the training data. Second, a clean input can
be changed by a small, and often imperceptible for human vision, perturbation,
so that the resulting deformed input is misclassified by the network. These
findings emphasize the differences between the ways DNN and humans classify
patterns, and raise a question of designing learning algorithms that more
accurately mimic human perception compared to the existing methods.
Our paper examines these questions within the framework of Dense Associative
Memory (DAM) models. These models are defined by the energy function, with
higher order (higher than quadratic) interactions between the neurons. We show
that in the limit when the power of the interaction vertex in the energy
function is sufficiently large, these models have the following three
properties. First, the minima of the objective function are free from rubbish
images, so that each minimum is a semantically meaningful pattern. Second,
artificial patterns poised precisely at the decision boundary look ambiguous to
human subjects and share aspects of both classes that are separated by that
decision boundary. Third, adversarial images constructed by models with small
power of the interaction vertex, which are equivalent to DNN with rectified
linear units (ReLU), fail to transfer to and fool the models with higher order
interactions. This opens up a possibility to use higher order models for
detecting and stopping malicious adversarial attacks. The presented results
suggest that DAM with higher order energy functions are closer to human visual
perception than DNN with ReLUs.

21290,The Nature of Turbulence in the LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies,"  We present probability density functions and higher order (skewness and
kurtosis) analyses of the galaxy-wide and spatially-resolved HI column density
distributions in the LITTLE THINGS sample of dwarf irregular galaxies. This
analysis follows that of Burkhart et al. (2010) for the Small Magellanic Cloud.
About 60% of our sample have galaxy-wide values of kurtosis that are similar to
that found for the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a range up to much higher
values, and kurtosis increases with integrated star formation rate. Kurtosis
and skewness were calculated for radial annuli and for a grid of 32 pixel X 32
pixel kernels across each galaxy. For most galaxies, kurtosis correlates with
skewness. For about half of the galaxies, there is a trend of increasing
kurtosis with radius. The range of kurtosis and skewness values is modeled by
small variations in the Mach number close to the sonic limit and by conversion
of HI to molecules at high column density. The maximum HI column densities
decrease with increasing radius in a way that suggests molecules are forming in
the weak field limit, where H_2 formation balances photodissociation in
optically thin gas at the edges of clouds.

intermediate solutions between solitons and rational solutions. They are
considered as cerain limits of solitons. The Sato Grassmannian is extensively
used here to study the degeneration of solutions, since it directly connects
solutions of the KP-hierarchy to the defining equations of algebraic curves.We

(on average 10.23 words in all SemEval datasets with a standard deviation 4.84)
roughly lie in a low-rank subspace (roughly, rank 4). Motivated by this
observation, we represent a sentence by the low-rank subspace spanned by its
word vectors. Such an unsupervised representation is empirically validated via
semantic textual similarity tasks on 19 different datasets, where it
outperforms the sophisticated neural network models, including skip-thought
vectors, by 15% on average.

21294,Kinetic Energy Density Functionals by Axiomatic Approach,"  An axiomatic approach is herein used to determine the physically acceptable
forms for general $D$-dimensional kinetic energy density functionals (KEDF).
The resulted expansion captures most of the known forms of one-point KEDFs. By
statistically training the KEDF forms on a model problem of non-interacting
kinetic energy in 1D (6 terms only), the mean relative accuracy for 1000
randomly generated potentials is found to be better than the standard KEDF by
several orders of magnitudes. The accuracy improves with the number of occupied
states and was found to be better than $10^{-4}$ for a system with four
occupied states. Furthermore, we show that free fitting of the coefficients
associated with known KEDFs approaches the exactly analytic values. The
presented approach can open a new route to search for physically acceptable
kinetic energy density functionals and provide an essential step towards more
accurate large-scale orbital free density functional theory calculations.

21295,Locating Power Flow Solution Space Boundaries: A Numerical Polynomial Homotopy Approach,"  The solution space of any set of power flow equations may contain different
number of real-valued solutions. The boundaries that separate these regions are
referred to as power flow solution space boundaries. Knowledge of these
boundaries is important as they provide a measure for voltage stability.
Traditionally, continuation based methods have been employed to compute these
boundaries on the basis of initial guesses for the solution. However, with
rapid growth of renewable energy sources these boundaries will be increasingly
affected by variable parameters such as penetration levels, locations of the
renewable sources, and voltage set-points, making it difficult to generate an
initial guess that can guarantee all feasible solutions for the power flow
problem. In this paper we solve this problem by applying a numerical polynomial
homotopy based continuation method. The proposed method guarantees to find all
solution boundaries within a given parameter space up to a chosen level of
discretization, independent of any initial guess. Power system operators can
use this computational tool conveniently to plan the penetration levels of
renewable sources at different buses. We illustrate the proposed method through
simulations on 3-bus and 10-bus power system examples with renewable
generation.

devices. Al2O3 films deposited on semiconductors usually exhibit amorphous due
to lattice mismatch. Compared to two-dimensional graphene, MoS2 is a typical
semiconductor, therefore, it has more extensive application. The
amorphous-Al2O3/MoS2 (a-Al2O3/MoS2) interface has attracted people's attention
because of its unique properties. In this paper, the interface behaviors of
a-Al2O3/MoS2 under non-strain and biaxial strain are investigated by first
principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). First of all,
the generation process of a-Al2O3 sample is described, which is calculated by
molecular dynamics and geometric optimization. Then, we introduce the band
alignment method, and calculate band offset of a-Al2O3/MoS2 interface. It is
found that the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO)
change with the number of MoS2 layers. The dependence of leakage current on the
band offset is also illustrated. At last, the band structure of monolayer MoS2
under biaxial strain is discussed. The biaxial strain is set in the range from

are known to reproduce the qualitative features of this instability, producing
highly-dynamic, spatiotemporal patterns. However, it is unknown whether such
simulations are truly aperiodic or a type of complex periodic behavior. By
showing that the system possesses a sensitive dependence on initial conditions
and a positive largest Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda_1 \approx 1/\tau$, we
provide a tentative answer: continuum predictions of clustering are chaotic. We
further demonstrate that the chaotic behavior is dimensionally dependent, a
conclusion which unifies previous results and strongly suggests that the
chaotic behavior is not a result of the fundamental kinematic instability, but
of the secondary (inherently multidimensional) instability.

21299,Easing Tensions with Quartessence,"  Tensions between cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and the
growth of the large-scale structure (LSS) inferred from late-time probes pose a
serious challenge to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.
State-of-the-art CMB data from the Planck satellite predicts a higher rate of
structure growth than what preferred by low-redshift observables. Such tension
has hitherto eluded conclusive explanations in terms of straightforward
modifications to $\Lambda$CDM, e.g. the inclusion of massive neutrinos or a
dynamical dark energy component. Here, we investigate `quartessence' models,
where a single dark component mimics both dark matter and dark energy. We show
that such models greatly alleviate the tension between high and low redshift
observations, thanks to the non-vanishing sound speed of quartessence that
inhibits structure growth at late times on scales smaller than its
corresponding Jeans' length. In particular, the $3.4\sigma$ tension between CMB
and LSS observables is thoroughly reabsorbed. For this reason, we argue that
quartessence deserves further investigation and may lead to a deeper
understanding of the physics of the dark Universe.

21300,Stable high-pressure phases in the H-S system determined by chemically reacting hydrogen and sulfur,"  Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have been used to study
chemical reactions of molecular hydrogen (H2) with sulfur (S) at high
pressures. We find theoretically predicted Cccm and Im-3m H3S to be the
reaction products at 50 and 140 GPa, respectively. Im-3m H3S is a stable
crystalline phase above 140 GPa and it transforms to R3m H3S on pressure
release below 140 GPa. The latter phase is (meta)stable down to at least 70 GPa
where it transforms to Cccm H3S upon annealing (T<1300 K) to overcome the
kinetic hindrance. Cccm H3S has an extended structure with symmetric hydrogen
bonds at 50 GPa and upon decompression it experiences a transformation to a
molecular mixed H2S-H2 structure below 40 GPa without any apparent change in
the crystal symmetry.

21301,Learning Neurosymbolic Generative Models via Program Synthesis,"  Significant strides have been made toward designing better generative models
in recent years. Despite this progress, however, state-of-the-art approaches
are still largely unable to capture complex global structure in data. For
example, images of buildings typically contain spatial patterns such as windows
repeating at regular intervals; state-of-the-art generative methods can't
easily reproduce these structures. We propose to address this problem by
incorporating programs representing global structure into the generative
model---e.g., a 2D for-loop may represent a configuration of windows.
Furthermore, we propose a framework for learning these models by leveraging
program synthesis to generate training data. On both synthetic and real-world
data, we demonstrate that our approach is substantially better than the
state-of-the-art at both generating and completing images that contain global
structure.

21302,Collapsibility of marginal models for categorical data,"  We consider marginal log-linear models for parameterizing distributions on
multidimensional contingency tables. These models generalize ordinary
log-linear and multivariate logistic models, besides several others. First, we
obtain some characteristic properties of marginal log-linear parameters. Then
we define collapsibility and strict collapsibility of these parameters in a
general sense. Several necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsibility
and strict collapsibility are derived using the technique of MÃ¶bius
inversion. These include results for an arbitrary set of marginal log-linear
parameters having some common effects. The connections of collapsibility and
strict collapsibility to various forms of independence of the variables are
discussed. Finally, we establish a result on the relationship between
parameters with the same effect but different margins, and use it to
demonstrate smoothness of marginal log-linear models under collapsibility
conditions thereby obtaining a curved exponential family.

21303,Tunable viscosity modification with diluted particles: When particles decrease the viscosity of complex fluids,"  While spherical particles are the most studied viscosity modifiers, they are
well known only to increase viscosities, in particular at low concentrations.
Extended studies and theories on non-spherical particles find a more
complicated behavior, but still a steady increase. Involving platelets in
combination with complex fluids displays an even more complex scenario that we
analyze experimentally and theoretically as a function of platelet diameter, to
find the underlying concepts. Using a broad toolbox of different techniques we
were able to decrease the viscosity of crude oils although solid particles were
added. This apparent contradiction could lead to a wider range of applications.

21304,Research Portfolio Analysis and Topic Prominence,"  Stakeholders in the science system need to decide where to place their bets.
Example questions include: Which areas of research should get more funding? Who
should we hire? Which projects should we abandon and which new projects should
we start? Making informed choices requires knowledge about these research
options. Unfortunately, to date research portfolio options have not been
defined in a consistent, transparent and relevant manner. Furthermore, we don't
know how to define demand for these options. In this article, we address the
issues of consistency, transparency, relevance and demand by using a model of
science consisting of 91,726 topics (or research options) that contain over 58
million documents. We present a new indicator of topic prominence - a measure
of visibility, momentum and, ultimately, demand. We assign over $203 billion of
project-level funding data from STAR METRICS to individual topics in science,
and show that the indicator of topic prominence, explains over one-third of the
variance in current (or future) funding by topic. We also show that highly
prominent topics receive far more funding per researcher than topics that are
not prominent. Implications of these results for research planning and
portfolio analysis by institutions and researchers are emphasized.

21307,A Survey of Entorhinal Grid Cell Properties,"  About a decade ago grid cells were discovered in the medial entorhinal cortex
of rat. Their peculiar firing patterns, which correlate with periodic locations
in the environment, led to early hypothesis that grid cells may provide some
form of metric for space. Subsequent research has since uncovered a wealth of
new insights into the characteristics of grid cells and their neural
neighborhood, the parahippocampal-hippocampal region, calling for a revision
and refinement of earlier grid cell models. This survey paper aims to provide a
comprehensive summary of grid cell research published in the past decade. It
focuses on the functional characteristics of grid cells such as the influence
of external cues or the alignment to environmental geometry, but also provides
a basic overview of the underlying neural substrate.

21308,An Automata-based Abstract Semantics for String Manipulation Languages,"  In recent years, dynamic languages, such as JavaScript or Python, have faced
an important increment of usage in a wide range of fields and applications.
Their tricky and misunderstood behaviors pose a hard challenge for static
analysis of these programming languages. A key aspect of any dynamic language
program is the multiple usage of strings, since they can be implicitly
converted to another type value, transformed by string-to-code primitives or
used to access an object-property. Unfortunately, string analyses for dynamic
languages still lack of precision and do not take into account some important
string features. Moreover, string obfuscation is very popular in the context of
dynamic language malicious code, for example, to hide code information inside
strings and then to dynamically transform strings into executable code. In this
scenario, more precise string analyses become a necessity. This paper proposes
a new semantics for string analysis placing a first step for handling dynamic
languages string features.

21309,Context encoders as a simple but powerful extension of word2vec,"  With a simple architecture and the ability to learn meaningful word
embeddings efficiently from texts containing billions of words, word2vec
remains one of the most popular neural language models used today. However, as
only a single embedding is learned for every word in the vocabulary, the model
fails to optimally represent words with multiple meanings. Additionally, it is
not possible to create embeddings for new (out-of-vocabulary) words on the
spot. Based on an intuitive interpretation of the continuous bag-of-words
(CBOW) word2vec model's negative sampling training objective in terms of
predicting context based similarities, we motivate an extension of the model we
call context encoders (ConEc). By multiplying the matrix of trained word2vec
embeddings with a word's average context vector, out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
embeddings and representations for a word with multiple meanings can be created
based on the word's local contexts. The benefits of this approach are
illustrated by using these word embeddings as features in the CoNLL 2003 named
entity recognition (NER) task.

21310,Sandwiches Missing Two Ingredients of Order Four,"  For a set ${\cal F}$ of graphs, an instance of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free
Sandwich Problem} is a pair $(G_1,G_2)$ consisting of two graphs $G_1$ and
$G_2$ with the same vertex set such that $G_1$ is a subgraph of $G_2$, and the
task is to determine an ${\cal F}$-free graph $G$ containing $G_1$ and
contained in $G_2$, or to decide that such a graph does not exist. Initially
motivated by the graph sandwich problem for trivially perfect graphs, which are
the $\{ P_4,C_4\}$-free graphs, we study the complexity of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc

of order four. We show that if ${\cal F}$ is one of the sets $\left\{ {\rm

21311,Butterfly velocity and bulk causal structure,"  The butterfly velocity was recently proposed as a characteristic velocity of
chaos propagation in a local system. Compared to the Lieb-Robinson velocity
that bounds the propagation speed of all perturbations, the butterfly velocity,
studied in thermal ensembles, is an ""effective"" Lieb-Robinson velocity for a
subspace of the Hilbert space defined by the microcanonical ensemble. In this
paper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case
to a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider
the code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.
Using local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation
between the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk
causal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the
bulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given
Lieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light
cone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the
butterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the
local reconstructions of bulk local operators. If the bulk geometry satisfies
Einstein equation and the null energy condition, for rotation symmetric
geometries we prove that infrared operators always have a slower butterfly
velocity that the ultraviolet one. For asymptotic AdS geometries, this also
implies that the butterfly velocities of all operators are upper bounded by the
speed of light. We further prove that the butterfly velocity is equal to the
speed of light if the causal wedge of the boundary region coincides with its
entanglement wedge. Finally, we discuss the implication of our result to
geometries that are not asymptotically AdS, and in particular, obtain
constraints that must be satisfied by a dual theory of flat space gravity.

21312,Correlated atomic wires on substrates. II. Application to Hubbard wires,"  In the first part of our theoretical study of correlated atomic wires on
substrates, we introduced lattice models for a one-dimensional quantum wire on
a three-dimensional substrate and their approximation by quasi-one-dimensional
effective ladder models [arXiv:1704.07350]. In this second part, we apply this
approach to the case of a correlated wire with a Hubbard-type electron-electron
repulsion deposited on an insulating substrate. The ground-state and spectral
properties are investigated numerically using the density-matrix
renormalization group method and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. As a function
of the model parameters, we observe various phases with quasi-one-dimensional
low-energy excitations localized in the wire, namely paramagnetic Mott
insulators, Luttinger liquids, and spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chains. The validity
of the effective ladder models is assessed by studying the convergence with the
number of legs and comparing to the full three-dimensional model. We find that
narrow ladder models accurately reproduce the quasi-one-dimensional excitations
of the full three-dimensional model but predict only qualitatively whether
excitations are localized around the wire or delocalized in the
three-dimensional substrate.

21313,Distributed Bayesian Piecewise Sparse Linear Models,"  The importance of interpretability of machine learning models has been
increasing due to emerging enterprise predictive analytics, threat of data
privacy, accountability of artificial intelligence in society, and so on.
Piecewise linear models have been actively studied to achieve both accuracy and
interpretability. They often produce competitive accuracy against
state-of-the-art non-linear methods. In addition, their representations (i.e.,
rule-based segmentation plus sparse linear formula) are often preferred by
domain experts. A disadvantage of such models, however, is high computational
cost for simultaneous determinations of the number of ""pieces"" and cardinality
of each linear predictor, which has restricted their applicability to
middle-scale data sets. This paper proposes a distributed factorized asymptotic
Bayesian (FAB) inference of learning piece-wise sparse linear models on
distributed memory architectures. The distributed FAB inference solves the
simultaneous model selection issue without communicating $O(N)$ data where N is
the number of training samples and achieves linear scale-out against the number
of CPU cores. Experimental results demonstrate that the distributed FAB
inference achieves high prediction accuracy and performance scalability with
both synthetic and benchmark data.

21314,Mercury's magnetic field in the MESSENGER era,"  MESSENGER magnetometer data show that Mercury's magnetic field is not only
exceptionally weak but also has a unique geometry. The internal field resembles
an axial dipole that is offset to the North by 20% of the planetary radius.
This implies that the axial quadrupol is particularly strong while the dipole
tilt is likely below 0.8 degree. The close proximity to the sun in combination
with the weak internal field results in a very small and highly dynamic Hermean
magnetosphere. We review the current understanding of Mercury's internal and
external magnetic field and discuss possible explanations. Classical convection
driven core dynamos have a hard time to reproduce the observations. Strong
quadrupol contributions can be promoted by different measures, but they always
go along with a large dipole tilt and generally rather small scale fields. A
stably stratified outer core region seems required to explain not only the
particular geometry but also the weakness of the Hermean magnetic field. New
interior models suggest that Mercury's core likely hosts an iron snow zone
underneath the core-mantle boundary. The positive radial sulfur gradient likely
to develop in such a zone would indeed promote stable stratification. However,
even dynamo models that include the stable layer show Mercury-like magnetic
fields only for a fraction of the total simulation time. Large scale variations
in the core-mantle boundary heat flux promise to yield more persistent results
but are not compatible with the current understanding of Mercury's lower
mantle.

21315,A two-stage approach for estimating the parameters of an age-group epidemic model from incidence data,"  Age-dependent dynamics is an important characteristic of many infectious
diseases. Age-group epidemic models describe the infection dynamics in
different age-groups by allowing to set distinct parameter values for each.
However, such models are highly nonlinear and may have a large number of
unknown parameters. Thus, parameter estimation of age-group models, while
becoming a fundamental issue for both the scientific study and policy making in
infectious diseases, is not a trivial task in practice. In this paper, we
examine the estimation of the so called next-generation matrix using incidence
data of a single entire outbreak, and extend the approach to deal with
recurring outbreaks. Unlike previous studies, we do not assume any constraints
regarding the structure of the matrix. A novel two-stage approach is developed,
which allows for efficient parameter estimation from both statistical and
computational perspectives. Simulation studies corroborate the ability to
estimate accurately the parameters of the model for several realistic
scenarios. The model and estimation method are applied to real data of
influenza-like-illness in Israel. The parameter estimates of the key relevant
epidemiological parameters and the recovered structure of the estimated
next-generation matrix are in line with results obtained in previous studies.

21316,Sequential Double Robustness in Right-Censored Longitudinal Models,"  Consider estimating the G-formula for the counterfactual mean outcome under a
given treatment regime in a longitudinal study. Bang and Robins provided an
estimator for this quantity that relies on a sequential regression formulation
of this parameter. This approach is doubly robust in that it is consistent if
either the outcome regressions or the treatment mechanisms are consistently
estimated. We define a stronger notion of double robustness, termed sequential
double robustness, for estimators of the longitudinal G-formula. The definition
emerges naturally from a more general definition of sequential double
robustness for the outcome regression estimators. An outcome regression
estimator is sequentially doubly robust (SDR) if, at each subsequent time
point, either the outcome regression or the treatment mechanism is consistently
estimated. This form of robustness is exactly what one would anticipate is
attainable by studying the remainder term of a first-order expansion of the
G-formula parameter. We show that a particular implementation of an existing
procedure is SDR. We also introduce a novel SDR estimator, whose development
involves a novel translation of ideas used in targeted minimum loss-based
estimation to the infinite-dimensional setting.

21317,On the treewidth of triangulated 3-manifolds,"  In graph theory, as well as in 3-manifold topology, there exist several
width-type parameters to describe how ""simple"" or ""thin"" a given graph or
3-manifold is. These parameters, such as pathwidth or treewidth for graphs, or
the concept of thin position for 3-manifolds, play an important role when
studying algorithmic problems; in particular, there is a variety of problems in
computational 3-manifold topology - some of them known to be computationally
hard in general - that become solvable in polynomial time as soon as the dual
graph of the input triangulation has bounded treewidth.
In view of these algorithmic results, it is natural to ask whether every
3-manifold admits a triangulation of bounded treewidth. We show that this is
not the case, i.e., that there exists an infinite family of closed 3-manifolds
not admitting triangulations of bounded pathwidth or treewidth (the latter
implies the former, but we present two separate proofs).
We derive these results from work of Agol, of Scharlemann and Thompson, and
of Scharlemann, Schultens and Saito by exhibiting explicit connections between
the topology of a 3-manifold M on the one hand and width-type parameters of the
dual graphs of triangulations of M on the other hand, answering a question that
had been raised repeatedly by researchers in computational 3-manifold topology.
In particular, we show that if a closed, orientable, irreducible, non-Haken
3-manifold M has a triangulation of treewidth (resp. pathwidth) k then the
Heegaard genus of M is at most 24(k+1) (resp. 4(3k+1)).

21318,The Geometry of Large Tundra Lakes Observed in Historical Maps and Satellite Images,"  Tundra lakes are key components of the Arctic climate system because they
represent a source of methane to the atmosphere. In this paper, we aim to
analyze the geometry of the patterns formed by large ($>0.8$ km$^2$) tundra
lakes in the Russian High Arctic. We have studied images of tundra lakes in
historical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale
$0.21166$ km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google
Earth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale $0.1503$ km/pixel). The G.E.E. is a
cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis on over four
decades of Landsat data. We developed an image-processing algorithm to segment
these maps and images, measure the area and perimeter of each lake, and compute
the fractal dimension of the lakes in the images we have studied. Our results
indicate that as lake size increases, their fractal dimension bifurcates. For
lakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger
than $100$ km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.43$ to $1.87$). For lakes observed in
satellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $\sim$100
km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.31$ to $1.95$). Tundra lakes with a fractal
dimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their
area--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes
with a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed.
Preliminary analysis of changes in lake size over time in paired lakes (lakes
that were visually matched in both the historical map and the satellite
imagery) indicate that some lakes in our study region have increased in size
over time, whereas others have decreased in size over time. Lake size change
during this 39-year time interval can be up to half the size of the lake as
recorded in the historical map.

21319,Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for scattered shrub detection with Google Earth Imagery,"  There is a growing demand for accurate high-resolution land cover maps in
many fields, e.g., in land-use planning and biodiversity conservation.
Developing such maps has been performed using Object-Based Image Analysis
(OBIA) methods, which usually reach good accuracies, but require a high human
supervision and the best configuration for one image can hardly be extrapolated
to a different image. Recently, the deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have shown outstanding results in object recognition in the field of

mapping for detecting species of high biodiversity conservation interest. This
paper analyzes the potential of CNNs-based methods for plant species detection
using free high-resolution Google Earth T M images and provides an objective
comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study
the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs, which are protected as a priority
habitat under the European Union Habitats Directive. According to our results,
compared to OBIA-based methods, the proposed CNN-based detection model, in
combination with data-augmentation, transfer learning and pre-processing,
achieves higher performance with less human intervention and the knowledge it
acquires in the first image can be transferred to other images, which makes the
detection process very fast. The provided methodology can be systematically
reproduced for other species detection.

unsupervised way. To achieve all the three tasks together, we learn the forward
and inverse mapping between data and representation on the basis of a symmetric
adversarial process. In theory, we minimize the upper bound of the two
conditional entropy loss between the latent variables and the observations
together to achieve the cycle consistency. The newly proposed RepGAN is tested
on MNIST, fashionMNIST, CelebA, and SVHN datasets to perform unsupervised or
semi-supervised classification, generation and reconstruction tasks. The result
demonstrates that RepGAN is able to learn a useful and competitive
representation. To the author's knowledge, our work is the first one to achieve
both a high unsupervised classification accuracy and low reconstruction error
on MNIST.

network security. Game-theoretic models called ""cheap talk signaling games""
capture the dynamic and information asymmetric nature of deceptive
interactions. But signaling games inherently model undetectable deception. In
this paper, we investigate a model of signaling games in which the receiver can
detect deception with some probability. This model nests traditional signaling
games and complete information Stackelberg games as special cases. We present
the pure strategy perfect Bayesian Nash equilibria of the game. Then we
illustrate these analytical results with an application to active network
defense. The presence of evidence forces majority-truthful behavior and
eliminates some pure strategy equilibria. It always benefits the deceived
player, but surprisingly sometimes also benefits the deceiving player.

21327,Parameterized Shifted Combinatorial Optimization,"  Shifted combinatorial optimization is a new nonlinear optimization framework
which is a broad extension of standard combinatorial optimization, involving
the choice of several feasible solutions at a time. This framework captures
well studied and diverse problems ranging from so-called vulnerability problems
to sharing and partitioning problems. In particular, every standard
combinatorial optimization problem has its shifted counterpart, which is
typically much harder. Already with explicitly given input set the shifted
problem may be NP-hard. In this article we initiate a study of the
parameterized complexity of this framework. First we show that shifting over an
explicitly given set with its cardinality as the parameter may be in XP, FPT or
P, depending on the objective function. Second, we study the shifted problem
over sets definable in MSO logic (which includes, e.g., the well known MSO
partitioning problems). Our main results here are that shifted combinatorial
optimization over MSO definable sets is in XP with respect to the MSO formula
and the treewidth (or more generally clique-width) of the input graph, and is
W[1]-hard even under further severe restrictions.

regarding ride-sharing. In the latter, we use pricing and travel time data from
a ride-sharing company to construct the transition probabilities and rewards of
the Markov decision process.

21331,Correlations and confinement of excitations in an asymmetric Hubbard ladder,"  Correlation functions and low-energy excitations are investigated in the
asymmetric two-leg ladder consisting of a Hubbard chain and a noninteracting
tight-binding (Fermi) chain using the density matrix renormalization group
method. The behavior of charge, spin and pairing correlations is discussed for
the four phases found at half filling, namely, Luttinger liquid, Kondo-Mott
insulator, spin-gapped Mott insulator and correlated band insulator.
Quasi-long-range antiferromagnetic spin correlations are found in the Hubbard
leg in the Luttinger liquid phase only. Pair-density-wave correlations are
studied to understand the structure of bound pairs found in the Fermi leg of
the spin-gapped Mott phase at half filling and at light doping but we find no
enhanced pairing correlations. Low-energy excitations cause variations of spin
and charge densities on both legs that demonstrate the confinement of the
lowest charge excitations on the Fermi leg while the lowest spin excitations
are localized on the Hubbard leg in the three insulating phases. The velocities
of charge, spin, and single-particle excitations are investigated to clarify
the confinement of elementary excitations in the Luttinger liquid phase. The
observed spatial separation of elementary spin and charge excitations could
facilitate the coexistence of different (quasi-)long-range orders in
higher-dimensional extensions of the asymmetric Hubbard ladder.

21332,Notes about collision monochromatization in $e^+e^-$ colliders,"  The manuscript describes several monochromatization schemes starting from
A.~Renieri \cite{ref:Renieri} proposal for head-on collisions based on
correlation between particles transverse position and energy deviation. We
briefly explain initial proposal and expand it for crossing angle collisions.
Then we discuss new monochromatization scheme for crossing angle collisions
based on correlation between particles longitudinal position and energy
deviation.

21333,Combinatorial Cost Sharing,"  We introduce a combinatorial variant of the cost sharing problem: several
services can be provided to each player and each player values every
combination of services differently. A publicly known cost function specifies
the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial
cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player
gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are
(economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging
(i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting,
combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing
dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task.
We present the Potential Mechanism -- a combination of the VCG mechanism and
a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's
potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism
that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the
same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution
shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is
approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations,
symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with
general valuations.

21334,A new family of one-coincidence sets of sequences with dispersed elements for frequency hopping CDMA systems,"  We present a new family of one-coincidence sequence sets suitable for
frequency hopping code division multiple access (FH-CDMA) systems with
dispersed (low density) sequence elements. These sets are derived from
one-coincidence prime sequence sets, such that for each one-coincidence prime
sequence set there is a new one-coincidence set comprised of sequences with
dispersed sequence elements, required in some circumstances, for FH-CDMA
systems. Getting rid of crowdedness of sequence elements is achieved by
doubling the size of the sequence element alphabet. In addition, this doubling
process eases control over the distance between adjacent sequence elements.
Properties of the new sets are discussed.

21335,Crowdsourcing with Tullock contests: A new perspective,"  Incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing have been extensively studied under
the framework of all-pay auctions. Along a distinct line, this paper proposes
to use Tullock contests as an alternative tool to design incentive mechanisms
for crowdsourcing. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to
attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.
In this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by
superseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock
contests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's
contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that
this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited
for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b)
it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to
an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional,
fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to
compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our
mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds
on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players'
social welfare.

21336,Can Decentralized Algorithms Outperform Centralized Algorithms? A Case Study for Decentralized Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent,"  Most distributed machine learning systems nowadays, including TensorFlow and
CNTK, are built in a centralized fashion. One bottleneck of centralized
algorithms lies on high communication cost on the central node. Motivated by
this, we ask, can decentralized algorithms be faster than its centralized
counterpart?
Although decentralized PSGD (D-PSGD) algorithms have been studied by the
control community, existing analysis and theory do not show any advantage over
centralized PSGD (C-PSGD) algorithms, simply assuming the application scenario
where only the decentralized network is available. In this paper, we study a
D-PSGD algorithm and provide the first theoretical analysis that indicates a
regime in which decentralized algorithms might outperform centralized
algorithms for distributed stochastic gradient descent. This is because D-PSGD
has comparable total computational complexities to C-PSGD but requires much
less communication cost on the busiest node. We further conduct an empirical
study to validate our theoretical analysis across multiple frameworks (CNTK and
Torch), different network configurations, and computation platforms up to 112
GPUs. On network configurations with low bandwidth or high latency, D-PSGD can
be up to one order of magnitude faster than its well-optimized centralized
counterparts.

21337,Learning User Intent from Action Sequences on Interactive Systems,"  Interactive systems have taken over the web and mobile space with increasing
participation from users. Applications across every marketing domain can now be
accessed through mobile or web where users can directly perform certain actions
and reach a desired outcome. Actions of user on a system, though, can be
representative of a certain intent. Ability to learn this intent through user's
actions can help draw certain insight into the behavior of users on a system.
In this paper, we present models to optimize interactive systems by learning
and analyzing user intent through their actions on the system. We present a
four phased model that uses time-series of interaction actions sequentially
using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based sequence learning system that helps
build a model for intent recognition. Our system then provides an objective
specific maximization followed by analysis and contrasting methods in order to
identify spaces of improvement in the interaction system. We discuss deployment
scenarios for such a system and present results from evaluation on an online
marketplace using user clickstream data.

21338,Laman Graphs are Generically Bearing Rigid in Arbitrary Dimensions,"  This paper addresses the problem of constructing bearing rigid networks in
arbitrary dimensions. We first show that the bearing rigidity of a network is a
generic property that is critically determined by the underlying graph of the
network. A new notion termed generic bearing rigidity is defined for graphs. If
the underlying graph of a network is generically bearing rigid, then the
network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations; otherwise, the network
is not bearing rigid for any configuration. As a result, the key to construct
bearing rigid networks is to construct generically bearing rigid graphs. The
main contribution of this paper is to prove that Laman graphs, which can be
generated by the Henneberg construction, are generically bearing rigid in
arbitrary dimensions. As a consequence, if the underlying graph of a network is
Laman, the network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations in arbitrary
dimensions.

21339,"Finding Dominating Induced Matchings in $(S_{2,2,3})$-Free Graphs in Polynomial Time","  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite undirected graph. An edge set $E' \subseteq E$ is a
{\em dominating induced matching} ({\em d.i.m.}) in $G$ if every edge in $E$ is
intersected by exactly one edge of $E'$. The \emph{Dominating Induced Matching}
(\emph{DIM}) problem asks for the existence of a d.i.m.\ in $G$; this problem
is also known as the \emph{Efficient Edge Domination} problem; it is the
Efficient Domination problem for line graphs.
The DIM problem is motivated by parallel resource allocation problems,
encoding theory and network routing. It is \NP-complete even for very
restricted graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3
and is solvable in linear time for $P_7$-free graphs, and in polynomial time
for $S_{1,2,4}$-free graphs as well as for $S_{2,2,2}$-free graphs. In this
paper, combining two distinct approaches, we solve it in polynomial time for
$S_{2,2,3}$-free graphs.

21340,Symmetry reduction and soliton-like solutions for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation,"  We analyze the gKdV equation, a generalized version of Korteweg-de Vries with
an arbitrary function $f(u)$. In general, for a function $f(u)$ the Lie algebra
of symmetries of gKdV is the $2$-dimensional Lie algebra of translations of the
plane $xt$. This implies the existence of plane wave solutions. Indeed, for
some specific values of $f(u)$ the equation gKdV admits a Lie algebra of
symmetries of dimension grater than $2$. We compute the similarity reductions
corresponding to these exceptional symmetries. We prove that the gKdV equation
has soliton-like solutions under some general assumptions, and we find a closed
formula for the plane wave solutions, that are of hyperbolic secant type.

21341,Existence theory for magma equations in dimension two and higher,"  We examine a degenerate, dispersive, nonlinear wave equation related to the
evolution of partially molten rock in dimensions two and higher. This
simplified model, for a scalar field capturing the melt fraction by volume, has
been studied by direct numerical simulation where it has been observed to
develop stable solitary waves. In this work, we prove local in time
well-posedness results for the time dependent equation, on both the whole space
and the torus, for dimensions two and higher. We also prove the existence of
the solitary wave solutions in dimensions two and higher.

21342,A short guide through integration theorems of generalized distributions,"  The generalization of Frobenius' theorem to foliations with singularities is
usually attributed to Stefan and Sussmann, for their simultaneous discovery
around 1973. However, their result is often referred to without caring much on
the precise statement, as some sort of magic spell. This may be explained by
the fact that the literature is not consensual on a unique formulation of the
theorem, and because the history of the research leading to this result has
been flawed by many claims that turned to be refuted some years later. This,
together with the difficulty of doing proof-reading on this topic, brought much
confusion about the precise statement of Stefan-Sussmann's theorem. This paper
is dedicated to bring some light on this subject, by investigating the
different statements and arguments that were put forward in geometric control
theory between 1962 and 1994 regarding the problem of integrability of
generalized distributions. We will present the genealogy of the main ideas and
show that many mathematicians that were involved in this field made some
mistakes that were successfully refuted. Moreover, we want to address the
prominent influence of Hermann on this topic, as well as the fact that some
statements of Stefan and Sussmann turned to be wrong. In this paper, we intend
to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the problem of
integrability of generalized distributions, and to reduce the confusion
surrounding these difficult questions.

21343,Polarization induced interference within electromagnetically induced transparency for atoms of double-V linkage,"  People have been paying attention to the role of atoms' complex internal
level structures in the research of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) for a long time, where the various degenerate Zeeman levels usually
generate complex linkage patterns for the atomic transitions. It turns out,
with special choices of the atomic states and the atomic transitions' linkage
structure, clear signatures of quantum interference induced by the probe and
coupling light's polarizations can emerge from a typical EIT phenomena. We
propose to study a four state system with double-V linkage pattern for the
transitions and analyze the polarization induced interference under the EIT
condition. We show that such interference arises naturally under mild
conditions on the optical field and atom manipulation. Its anticipated
properties and its potential application of all optical switching in
polarization degree of freedom are also discussed. Moreover, we construct a
variation form of double-M linkage pattern where the polarization induced
interference enables polarization-dependent cross-modulation between incident
lights that can be effective even at the few-photon level. The theme is to gain
more insight into the essential question: how can we build non-trivial optical
medium where incident lights will induce polarization-dependent non-linear
optical interactions, covering a wide range of the incidence intensity from the
many-photon level to the few-photon level, respectively.

21345,Differential Evolution and Bayesian Optimisation for Hyper-Parameter Selection in Mixed-Signal Neuromorphic Circuits Applied to UAV Obstacle Avoidance,"  The Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) is a an identified neuron of the
locust that detects looming objects and triggers its escape responses.
Understanding the neural principles and networks that lead to these fast and
robust responses can lead to the design of efficient facilitate obstacle
avoidance strategies in robotic applications. Here we present a neuromorphic
spiking neural network model of the LGMD driven by the output of a neuromorphic
Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), which has been optimised to produce robust and
reliable responses in the face of the constraints and variability of its mixed
signal analogue-digital circuits. As this LGMD model has many parameters, we
use the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to optimise its parameter space.
We also investigate the use of Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (SADE)
which has been shown to ameliorate the difficulties of finding appropriate
input parameters for DE. We explore the use of two biological mechanisms:
synaptic plasticity and membrane adaptivity in the LGMD. We apply DE and SADE
to find parameters best suited for an obstacle avoidance system on an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV), and show how it outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian
optimisation used for comparison.

21346,Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking,"  Methods that learn representations of nodes in a graph play a critical role
in network analysis since they enable many downstream learning tasks. We
propose Graph2Gauss - an approach that can efficiently learn versatile node
embeddings on large scale (attributed) graphs that show strong performance on
tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most approaches
that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, we
embed each node as a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to capture uncertainty
about the representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised method that
handles inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to different types of
graphs: plain/attributed, directed/undirected. By leveraging both the network
structure and the associated node attributes, we are able to generalize to
unseen nodes without additional training. To learn the embeddings we adopt a
personalized ranking formulation w.r.t. the node distances that exploits the
natural ordering of the nodes imposed by the network structure. Experiments on
real world networks demonstrate the high performance of our approach,
outperforming state-of-the-art network embedding methods on several different
tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling uncertainty - by
analyzing it we can estimate neighborhood diversity and detect the intrinsic
latent dimensionality of a graph.

21347,Explaining Anomalies in Groups with Characterizing Subspace Rules,"  Anomaly detection has numerous applications and has been studied vastly. We
consider a complementary problem that has a much sparser literature: anomaly
description. Interpretation of anomalies is crucial for practitioners for
sense-making, troubleshooting, and planning actions. To this end, we present a
new approach called x-PACS (for eXplaining Patterns of Anomalies with
Characterizing Subspaces), which ""reverse-engineers"" the known anomalies by
identifying (1) the groups (or patterns) that they form, and (2) the
characterizing subspace and feature rules that separate each anomalous pattern
from normal instances. Explaining anomalies in groups not only saves analyst
time and gives insight into various types of anomalies, but also draws
attention to potentially critical, repeating anomalies.
In developing x-PACS, we first construct a desiderata for the anomaly
description problem. From a descriptive data mining perspective, our method
exhibits five desired properties in our desiderata. Namely, it can unearth
anomalous patterns (i) of multiple different types, (ii) hidden in arbitrary
subspaces of a high dimensional space, (iii) interpretable by the analysts,
(iv) different from normal patterns of the data, and finally (v) succinct,
providing the shortest data description. Furthermore, x-PACS is highly
parallelizable and scales linearly in terms of data size.
No existing work on anomaly description satisfies all of these properties
simultaneously. While not our primary goal, the anomalous patterns we find
serve as interpretable ""signatures"" and can be used for detection. We show the
effectiveness of x-PACS in explanation as well as detection on real-world
datasets as compared to state-of-the-art.

21348,VAMPnets: Deep learning of molecular kinetics,"  There is an increasing demand for computing the relevant structures,
equilibria and long-timescale kinetics of biomolecular processes, such as
protein-drug binding, from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations.
Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural
features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension-reduced data, and
estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion
rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a
substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will
lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for
Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular
kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire
mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole
data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs
equally or better than state-of-the art Markov modeling methods and provides
easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.

21349,Toward deciphering developmental patterning with deep neural network,"  Dynamics of complex biological systems is driven by intricate networks, the
current knowledge of which are often incomplete. The traditional systems
biology modeling usually implements an ad hoc fixed set of differential
equations with predefined function forms. Such an approach often suffers from
overfitting or underfitting and thus inadequate predictive power, especially
when dealing with systems of high complexity. This problem could be overcome by
deep neuron network (DNN). Choosing pattern formation of the gap genes in
Drosophila early embryogenesis as an example, we established a differential
equation model whose synthesis term is expressed as a DNN. The model yields
perfect fitting and impressively accurate predictions on mutant patterns. We
further mapped the trained DNN into a simplified conventional regulation
network, which is consistent with the existing body of knowledge. The DNN model
could lay a foundation of ""in-silico-embryo"", which can regenerate a great
variety of interesting phenomena, and on which one can perform all kinds of
perturbations to discover underlying mechanisms. This approach can be readily
applied to a variety of complex biological systems.

21350,Whispered-to-voiced Alaryngeal Speech Conversion with Generative Adversarial Networks,"  Most methods of voice restoration for patients suffering from aphonia either
produce whispered or monotone speech. Apart from intelligibility, this type of
speech lacks expressiveness and naturalness due to the absence of pitch
(whispered speech) or artificial generation of it (monotone speech). Existing
techniques to restore prosodic information typically combine a vocoder, which
parameterises the speech signal, with machine learning techniques that predict
prosodic information. In contrast, this paper describes an end-to-end neural
approach for estimating a fully-voiced speech waveform from whispered
alaryngeal speech. By adapting our previous work in speech enhancement with
generative adversarial networks, we develop a speaker-dependent model to
perform whispered-to-voiced speech conversion. Preliminary qualitative results
show effectiveness in re-generating voiced speech, with the creation of
realistic pitch contours.

21351,A graph-theoretic description of scale-multiplicative semigroups of automorphisms,"  It is shown that a flat subgroup, $H$, of the totally disconnected, locally
compact group $G$ decomposes into a finite number of subsemigroups on which the
scale function is multiplicative. The image, $P$, of a multiplicative semigroup
in the quotient, $H/H(1)$, of $H$ by its uniscalar subgroup has a unique
minimal generating set which determines a natural Cayley graph structure on
$P$. For each compact, open subgroup $U$ of $G$, a graph is defined and it is
shown that if $P$ is multiplicative over $U$ then this graph is a regular,

21352,Half-Heusler alloy LiBaBi: A new topological semimetal with five-fold band degeneracy,"  Based on first-principles study, we report the finding of a new topological
semimetal LiBaBi in half-Heusler phase. The remarkable feature of this
nonmagnetic, inversion-symmetry-breaking material is that it consists of only
simple $s$- and $p$-block elements. Interestingly, the material is ordinary
insulator in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and becomes nodal-surface
topological semimetal showing drumhead states when SOC is included. This is in
stark contrast to other nodal-line and nodal-surface semimetals, where the
extended nodal structure is destroyed once SOC is included. Importantly, the
linear band crossings host three-, four-, five- and six-fold degeneracies near
the Fermi level, making this compound very attractive for the study of
`unconventional' fermions. The band crossing points form a three-dimensional
nodal structure around the zone center at the Fermi level. We identify the
surface states responsible for the appearance of the drumhead states. The alloy
also shows a phase transition from topological semimetal to a trivial insulator
on application of pressure. In addition to revealing an intriguing effect of
SOC on the nodal structure, our findings introduce a new half-Heusler alloy in
the family of topological semimetals, thus creating more avenues for
experimental exploration.

21353,A task-driven implementation of a simple numerical solver for hyperbolic conservation laws,"  This article describes the implementation of an all-in-one numerical
procedure within the runtime StarPU. In order to limit the complexity of the
method, for the sake of clarity of the presentation of the non-classical
task-driven programming environnement, we have limited the numerics to first
order in space and time. Results show that the task distribution is efficient
if the tasks are numerous and individually large enough so that the task heap
can be saturated by tasks which computational time covers the task management
overhead. Next, we also see that even though they are mostly faster on graphic
cards, not all the tasks are suitable for GPUs, which brings forward the
importance of the task scheduler. Finally, we look at a more realistic system
of conservation laws with an expensive source term, what allows us to conclude
and open on future works involving higher local arithmetic intensity, by
increasing the order of the numerical method or by enriching the model
(increased number of parameters and therefore equations).

holds asymptotically by showing that the distance between the iterates of any
unital or trace preserving PPT map and the set of entanglement breaking maps
tends to zero. Finally, for every graph we define a one-parameter family of
maps on matrices and determine the least value of the parameter such that the
map is variously, positive, completely positive, PPT and entanglement breaking
in terms of properties of the graph. Our estimates are sharp enough to conclude
that Christandl's conjecture holds for these families.

21355,Multi-View Image Generation from a Single-View,"  This paper addresses a challenging problem -- how to generate multi-view
cloth images from only a single view input. To generate realistic-looking
images with different views from the input, we propose a new image generation
model termed VariGANs that combines the strengths of the variational inference
and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our proposed VariGANs model
generates the target image in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of a single pass
which suffers from severe artifacts. It first performs variational inference to
model global appearance of the object (e.g., shape and color) and produce a
coarse image with a different view. Conditioned on the generated low resolution
images, it then proceeds to perform adversarial learning to fill details and
generate images of consistent details with the input. Extensive experiments
conducted on two clothing datasets, MVC and DeepFashion, have demonstrated that
images of a novel view generated by our model are more plausible than those
generated by existing approaches, in terms of more consistent global appearance
as well as richer and sharper details.

eigenfunctions on simplices. We prove that the $L^2$ norm of the
(semi-classical) Neumann data on each face is equal to $2/n$ times the
$(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the face divided by the volume of the simplex.
This is a generalization of \cite{Chr-tri} to higher dimensions. Again it is
{\it not} an asymptotic, but an exact formula. The proof is by simple
integrations by parts and linear algebra.
We also consider the following inverse problem: do the {\it norms} of the
Neumann data on a simplex determine a constant coefficient elliptic operator?
The answer is yes in dimension 2 and no in higher dimensions.

21357,A machine learning approach for efficient uncertainty quantification using multiscale methods,"  Several multiscale methods account for sub-grid scale features using coarse
scale basis functions. For example, in the Multiscale Finite Volume method the
coarse scale basis functions are obtained by solving a set of local problems
over dual-grid cells. We introduce a data-driven approach for the estimation of
these coarse scale basis functions. Specifically, we employ a neural network
predictor fitted using a set of solution samples from which it learns to
generate subsequent basis functions at a lower computational cost than solving
the local problems. The computational advantage of this approach is realized
for uncertainty quantification tasks where a large number of realizations has
to be evaluated. We attribute the ability to learn these basis functions to the
modularity of the local problems and the redundancy of the permeability patches
between samples. The proposed method is evaluated on elliptic problems yielding
very promising results.

21358,Quadratic Upper Bound for Recursive Teaching Dimension of Finite VC Classes,"  In this work we study the quantitative relation between the recursive
teaching dimension (RTD) and the VC dimension (VCD) of concept classes of
finite sizes. The RTD of a concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n$,
introduced by Zilles et al. (2011), is a combinatorial complexity measure
characterized by the worst-case number of examples necessary to identify a
concept in $\mathcal C$ according to the recursive teaching model.
For any finite concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ with
$\mathrm{VCD}(\mathcal C)=d$, Simon & Zilles (2015) posed an open problem
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d)$, i.e., is RTD linearly upper bounded by VCD?
Previously, the best known result is an exponential upper bound
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d \cdot 2^d)$, due to Chen et al. (2016). In this
paper, we show a quadratic upper bound: $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d^2)$,
much closer to an answer to the open problem. We also discuss the challenges in
fully solving the problem.

sensor selection problem for stable linear systems with Kalman Filter.
Specifically, the objective is to find the system parameters that affects the
performance of greedy algorithms and conditions where greedy algorithm always

conditions where greedy algorithm will always produce the optimal solution. We
then show in simulations how the system parameters mentioned by the performance
ratio bound derived in this work affects the performance of greedy algorithm.

21361,Generators of reductions of ideals in a local Noetherian ring with finite residue field,"  Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a local Noetherian ring with residue field $k$.
While much is known about the generating sets of reductions of ideals of $R$ if
$k$ is infinite, the case in which $k$ is finite is less well understood. We
investigate the existence (or lack thereof) of proper reductions of an ideal of
$R$ and the number of generators needed for a reduction in the case $k$ is a
finite field. When $R$ is one-dimensional, we give a formula for the smallest
integer $n$ for which every ideal has an $n$-generated reduction. It follows
that in a one-dimensional local Noetherian ring every ideal has a principal
reduction if and only if the number of maximal ideals in the normalization of
the reduced quotient of $R$ is at most $|k|$. In higher dimensions, we show
that for any positive integer, there exists an ideal of $R$ that does not have
an $n$-generated reduction and that if $n \geq \dim R$ this ideal can be chosen
to be $\mathfrak{m}$-primary. In the case where $R$ is a two-dimensional
regular local ring, we construct an example of an integrally closed
$\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal that does not have a $2$-generated reduction and
thus answer in the negative a question raised by Heinzer and Shannon.

21362,Particle-like Structure of Lie algebras,"  If a Lie algebra structure g on a vector space is the sum of a family of
mutually compatible Lie algebra structures g_i's, we say that g is simply
assembled from the g_i's. Repeating this procedure with a number of Lie
algebras, themselves simply assembled from the g_i's, one obtains a Lie algebra
assembled in two steps from the g_i's, and so on. We describe the process of
modular disassembling of a Lie algebra into a unimodular and a non-unimodular
part. We then study two inverse questions: which Lie algebras can be assembled
from a given family of Lie algebras, and from which Lie algebras can a given
Lie algebra be assembled? We develop some basic assembling and disassembling
techniques that constitute the elements of a new approach to the general theory
of Lie algebras. The main result of our theory is that any finite-dimensional
Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or over R
can be assembled in a finite number of steps from two elementary constituents,
which we call dyons and triadons. Up to an abelian summand, a dyon is a Lie
algebra structure isomorphic to the non-abelian 2-dimensional Lie algebra,
while a triadon is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. As
an example, we describe constructions of classical Lie algebras from triadons.

21363,"Reversed Dickson polynomials of the $(k+1)$-th kind over finite fields, II","  Let $p$ be an odd prime. In this paper, we study the permutation behaviour of
the reversed Dickson polynomials of the $(k+1)$-th kind $D_{n,k}(1,x)$ when
$n=p^{l_1}+3$, $n=p^{l_1}+p^{l_2}+p^{l_3}$, and
$n=p^{l_1}+p^{l_2}+p^{l_3}+p^{l_4}$, where $l_1, l_2$, $l_3$, and $l_4$ are
non-negative integers. A generalization to $n=p^{l_1}+p^{l_2}+\cdots +p^{l_i}$
is also shown. We find some conditions under which $D_{n,k}(1,x)$ is not a
permutation polynomial over finite fields for certain values of $n$ and $k$. We
also present a generalization of a recent result regarding $D_{p^l-1,1}(1,x)$
and present some algebraic and arithmetic properties of $D_{n,k}(1,x)$.

21364,Improving Session Recommendation with Recurrent Neural Networks by Exploiting Dwell Time,"  Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been applied to the task of
session-based recommendation. These approaches use RNNs to predict the next
item in a user session based on the previ- ously visited items. While some
approaches consider additional item properties, we argue that item dwell time
can be used as an implicit measure of user interest to improve session-based
item recommen- dations. We propose an extension to existing RNN approaches that
captures user dwell time in addition to the visited items and show that
recommendation performance can be improved. Additionally, we investigate the
usefulness of a single validation split for model selection in the case of
minor improvements and find that in our case the best model is not selected and
a fold-like study with different validation sets is necessary to ensure the
selection of the best model.

21365,Universal Spatiotemporal Sampling Sets for Discrete Spatially Invariant Evolution Systems,"  Let $(I,+)$ be a finite abelian group and $\mathbf{A}$ be a circular
convolution operator on $\ell^2(I)$. The problem under consideration is how to
construct minimal $\Omega \subset I$ and $l_i$ such that $Y=\{\mathbf{e}_i,
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}_i, \cdots, \mathbf{A}^{l_i}\mathbf{e}_i: i\in \Omega\}$ is
a frame for $\ell^2(I)$, where $\{\mathbf{e}_i: i\in I\}$ is the canonical
basis of $\ell^2(I)$. This problem is motivated by the spatiotemporal sampling
problem in discrete spatially invariant evolution systems. We will show that
the cardinality of $\Omega $ should be at least equal to the largest geometric
multiplicity of eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, and we consider the universal
spatiotemporal sampling sets $(\Omega, l_i)$ for convolution operators
$\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues subject to the same largest geometric
multiplicity. We will give an algebraic characterization for such sampling sets
and show how this problem is linked with sparse signal processing theory and
polynomial interpolation theory.

method, which is used for classification of the extremely low frequency
magnetic field emission in the near neighborhood of the laptop adapters. The
experiment is performed on different laptop adapters of the same
characteristics. After that, the Self-Organizing-Map classification on the
obtained emission data is performed. The classification results establish the
typical emission levels of the laptop adapters, which are far above the safety
standards' limit. At the end, a discussion is carried out about the importance
of using the classification as a possible solution for safely use the laptop
adapters in order to reduce the negative effects of the magnetic field emission

21367,Attention Models in Graphs: A Survey,"  Graph-structured data arise naturally in many different application domains.
By representing data as graphs, we can capture entities (i.e., nodes) as well
as their relationships (i.e., edges) with each other. Many useful insights can
be derived from graph-structured data as demonstrated by an ever-growing body
of work focused on graph mining. However, in the real-world, graphs can be both
large - with many complex patterns - and noisy which can pose a problem for
effective graph mining. An effective way to deal with this issue is to
incorporate ""attention"" into graph mining solutions. An attention mechanism
allows a method to focus on task-relevant parts of the graph, helping it to
make better decisions. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and focused
survey of the literature on the emerging field of graph attention models. We
introduce three intuitive taxonomies to group existing work. These are based on
problem setting (type of input and output), the type of attention mechanism
used, and the task (e.g., graph classification, link prediction, etc.). We
motivate our taxonomies through detailed examples and use each to survey
competing approaches from a unique standpoint. Finally, we highlight several
challenges in the area and discuss promising directions for future work.

21368,Multiplexing 200 modes on a single digital hologram,"  The on-demand tailoring of light's spatial shape is of great relevance in a
wide variety of research areas. Computer-controlled devices, such as Spatial
Light Modulators (SLMs) or Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), offer a very
accurate, flexible and fast holographic means to this end. Remarkably, digital
holography affords the simultaneous generation of multiple beams
(multiplexing), a tool with numerous applications in many fields. Here, we
provide a self-contained tutorial on light beam multiplexing. Through the use
of several examples, the readers will be guided step by step in the process of
light beam shaping and multiplexing. Additionally, on the multiplexing

21369,Ranking influential spreaders is an ill-defined problem,"  Finding influential spreaders of information and disease in networks is an
important theoretical problem, and one of considerable recent interest. It has
been almost exclusively formulated as a node-ranking problem -- methods for
identifying influential spreaders rank nodes according to how influential they
are. In this work, we show that the ranking approach does not necessarily work:
the set of most influential nodes depends on the number of nodes in the set.
Therefore, the set of $n$ most important nodes to vaccinate does not need to
have any node in common with the set of $n+1$ most important nodes. We propose
a method for quantifying the extent and impact of this phenomenon, and show
that it is common in both empirical and model networks.

21370,Fixing a Broken ELBO,"  Recent work in unsupervised representation learning has focused on learning
deep directed latent-variable models. Fitting these models by maximizing the
marginal likelihood or evidence is typically intractable, thus a common
approximation is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. However,
maximum likelihood training (whether exact or approximate) does not necessarily
result in a good latent representation, as we demonstrate both theoretically
and empirically. In particular, we derive variational lower and upper bounds on
the mutual information between the input and the latent variable, and use these
bounds to derive a rate-distortion curve that characterizes the tradeoff
between compression and reconstruction accuracy. Using this framework, we
demonstrate that there is a family of models with identical ELBO, but different
quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Our framework also suggests a
simple new method to ensure that latent variable models with powerful
stochastic decoders do not ignore their latent code.

21371,Wavelet Shrinkage and Thresholding based Robust Classification for Brain Computer Interface,"  A macaque monkey is trained to perform two different kinds of tasks, memory
aided and visually aided. In each task, the monkey saccades to eight possible
target locations. A classifier is proposed for direction decoding and task
decoding based on local field potentials (LFP) collected from the prefrontal
cortex. The LFP time-series data is modeled in a nonparametric regression
framework, as a function corrupted by Gaussian noise. It is shown that if the
function belongs to Besov bodies, then using the proposed wavelet shrinkage and
thresholding based classifier is robust and consistent. The classifier is then
applied to the LFP data to achieve high decoding performance. The proposed
classifier is also quite general and can be applied for the classification of
other types of time-series data as well, not necessarily brain data.

21372,SCALAR - Simultaneous Calibration of 2D Laser and Robot's Kinematic Parameters Using Three Planar Constraints,"  Industrial robots are increasingly used in various applications where the
robot accuracy becomes very important, hence calibrations of the robot's
kinematic parameters and the measurement system's extrinsic parameters are
required. However, the existing calibration approaches are either too
cumbersome or require another expensive external measurement system such as
laser tracker or measurement spinarm. In this paper, we propose SCALAR, a
calibration method to simultaneously improve the kinematic parameters of a
6-DoF robot and the extrinsic parameters of a 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF) which
is attached to the robot. Three flat planes are placed around the robot, and
for each plane the robot moves to several poses such that the LRF's ray
intersect the respective plane. Geometric planar constraints are then used to
optimize the calibration parameters using Levenberg- Marquardt nonlinear
optimization algorithm. We demonstrate through simulations that SCALAR can
reduce the average position and orientation errors of the robot system from
14.6mm and 4.05 degrees to 0.09mm and 0.02 degrees.

Three studies were conducted in the context of 2 academic courses. The
participation in the Twitter activity was voluntarily for the students. In all

However, no relationship between the students personality traits and their

in learning. The implications of the conducted studies are discussed
extensively and a comparison with other related studies is presented.

21374,Entropic theory of Gravitation,"  We construct a manifestly Machian theory of gravitation on the foundation
that information in the universe cannot be destroyed (Landauer's principle). If
no bit of information in the Universe is lost, than the sum of the entropies of
the geometric and the matter fields should be conserved. We propose a local
invariant expression for the entropy of the geometric field and formulate a
variational principle on the entropic functional which produces entropic field
equations. This information-theoretic approach implies that the geometric field
does not exist in an empty of matter Universe, the material entropy is geometry
dependent, matter can exchange information (entropy) with the geometric field
and a quantum condensate can channel energy into the geometric field at a
particular coherent state. The entropic field equations feature a non-intuitive
direct coupling between the material fields and the geometric field, which acts
as an entropy reservoir. Cosmological consequences such as the emergence of the
cosmological constant as well as experimental consequences involving
gravity-quantum condensate interaction are discussed. The energetic aspect of
the theory restores the repertoire of the classical General Relativity up to a
different coupling constant between the fields.

21375,Understanding International Migration using Tensor Factorization,"  Understanding human migration is of great interest to demographers and social
scientists. User generated digital data has made it easier to study such
patterns at a global scale. Geo coded Twitter data, in particular, has been
shown to be a promising source to analyse large scale human migration. But
given the scale of these datasets, a lot of manual effort has to be put into
processing and getting actionable insights from this data.
In this paper, we explore feasibility of using a new tool, tensor
decomposition, to understand trends in global human migration. We model human
migration as a three mode tensor, consisting of (origin country, destination
country, time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to get meaningful low
dimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5
years and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration
patterns.

21376,Fiber-dependent deautonomization of integrable 2D mappings and discrete PainlevÃ© equations,"  It is well known that two-dimensional mappings preserving a rational elliptic
fibration, like the Quispel-Roberts-Thompson mappings, can be deautonomized to
discrete PainlevÃ© equations. However, the dependence of this procedure on the
choice of a particular elliptic fiber has not been sufficiently investigated.
In this paper we establish a way of performing the deautonomization for a pair
of an autonomous mapping and a fiber. %By choosing a particular Starting from a
single autonomous mapping but varying the type of a chosen fiber, we obtain
different types of discrete PainlevÃ© equations using this deautonomization
procedure. We also introduce a technique for reconstructing a mapping from the
knowledge of its induced action on the Picard group and some additional
geometric data. This technique allows us to obtain factorized expressions of
discrete PainlevÃ© equations, including the elliptic case. Further, by
imposing certain restrictions on such non-autonomous mappings we obtain new and
simple elliptic difference PainlevÃ© equations, including examples whose
symmetry groups do not appear explicitly in Sakai's classification.

21377,ZnO and ZnO$_{1-x}$ based thin film memristors: The effects of oxygen deficiency and thickness in resistive switching behavior,"  In this study, direct-current reactive sputtered ZnO and ZnO1-x based thin
film (30 nm and 300 nm in thickness) memristor devices were produced and the
effects of oxygen vacancies and thickness on the memristive characteristics
were investigated. The oxygen deficiency of the ZnO1-x structure was confirmed
by SIMS analyses. The memristive characteristics of both the ZnO and ZnO1-x
devices were determined by time dependent current-voltage (I-V-t) measurements.
The distinctive pinched hysteresis I-V loops of memristors were observed in all
the fabricated devices. The typical homogeneous interface and filamentary types
of memristive behaviors were compared. In addition, conduction mechanisms,
on/off ratios and the compliance current were analyzed. The 30 nm ZnO based
devices with native oxygen vacancies showed the best on/off ratio. All of the
devices exhibited dominant Schottky emissions and weaker Poole-Frenkel
conduction mechanisms. Results suggested that the oxygen deficiency was
responsible for the Schottky emission mechanism. Moreover, the compliance
currents of the devices were related to the decreasing power consumption as the
oxygen vacancies increased.

21378,Infrastructure Quality Assessment in Africa using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning,"  The UN Sustainable Development Goals allude to the importance of
infrastructure quality in three of its seventeen goals. However, monitoring
infrastructure quality in developing regions remains prohibitively expensive
and impedes efforts to measure progress toward these goals. To this end, we
investigate the use of widely available remote sensing data for the prediction
of infrastructure quality in Africa. We train a convolutional neural network to
predict ground truth labels from the Afrobarometer Round 6 survey using Landsat
8 and Sentinel 1 satellite imagery.
Our best models predict infrastructure quality with AUROC scores of 0.881 on
Electricity, 0.862 on Sewerage, 0.739 on Piped Water, and 0.786 on Roads using
Landsat 8. These performances are significantly better than models that
leverage OpenStreetMap or nighttime light intensity on the same tasks. We also
demonstrate that our trained model can accurately make predictions in an unseen
country after fine-tuning on a small sample of images. Furthermore, the model
can be deployed in regions with limited samples to predict infrastructure
outcomes with higher performance than nearest neighbor spatial interpolation.

21379,FrÃ©chet Means and Procrustes Analysis in Wasserstein Space,"  We consider two statistical problems at the intersection of functional and
non-Euclidean data analysis: the determination of a FrÃ©chet mean in the
Wasserstein space of multivariate distributions; and the optimal registration
of deformed random measures and point processes. We elucidate how the two
problems are linked, each being in a sense dual to the other. We first study
the finite sample version of the problem in the continuum. Exploiting the
tangent bundle structure of Wasserstein space, we deduce the FrÃ©chet mean via
gradient descent. We show that this is equivalent to a Procrustes analysis for
the registration maps, thus only requiring successive solutions to pairwise
optimal coupling problems. We then study the population version of the problem,
focussing on inference and stability: in practice, the data are i.i.d.
realisations from a law on Wasserstein space, and indeed their observation is
discrete, where one observes a proxy finite sample or point process. We
construct regularised nonparametric estimators, and prove their consistency for
the population mean, and uniform consistency for the population Procrustes
registration maps.

21380,Sliding-Window Superposition Coding:Two-User Interference Channels,"  A low-complexity coding scheme is developed to achieve the rate region of
maximum likelihood decoding for interference channels. As in the classical
rate-splitting multiple access scheme by Grant, Rimoldi, Urbanke, and Whiting,
the proposed coding scheme uses superposition of multiple codewords with
successive cancellation decoding, which can be implemented using standard
point-to-point encoders and decoders. Unlike rate-splitting multiple access,
which is not rate-optimal for multiple receivers, the proposed coding scheme
transmits codewords over multiple blocks in a staggered manner and recovers
them successively over sliding decoding windows, achieving the single-stream
optimal rate region as well as the more general Han--Kobayashi inner bound for
the two-user interference channel. The feasibility of this scheme in practice
is verified by implementing it using commercial channel codes over the two-user
Gaussian interference channel.

generated samples and the given training data. When followed by repeated
discriminative learning, desirable properties of modern discriminative
classifiers are directly inherited by the generator. IGM learns a cascade of
CNN classifiers using a synthesis-by-classification algorithm. In the
experiments, we observe encouraging results on a number of applications
including texture modeling, artistic style transferring, face modeling, and
semi-supervised learning.

a person's culture, hence generating differences in the way a same activity is
performed by individuals belonging to different cultures. We argue that taking
cultural information into account can improve the performance of systems for
the automated recognition of human activities. We propose four different
solutions to the problem and present a system which uses a Naive Bayes model to
associate cultural information with semantic information extracted from still
images. Preliminary experiments with a dataset of images of individuals lying
on the floor, sleeping on a futon and sleeping on a bed suggest that: i)
solutions explicitly taking cultural information into account are more accurate
than culture-unaware solutions; and ii) the proposed system is a promising
starting point for the development of culture-aware Human Activity Recognition
methods.

21384,Image classification using local tensor singular value decompositions,"  From linear classifiers to neural networks, image classification has been a
widely explored topic in mathematics, and many algorithms have proven to be
effective classifiers. However, the most accurate classifiers typically have
significantly high storage costs, or require complicated procedures that may be
computationally expensive. We present a novel (nonlinear) classification
approach using truncation of local tensor singular value decompositions (tSVD)
that robustly offers accurate results, while maintaining manageable storage
costs. Our approach takes advantage of the optimality of the representation
under the tensor algebra described to determine to which class an image
belongs. We extend our approach to a method that can determine specific
pairwise match scores, which could be useful in, for example, object
recognition problems where pose/position are different. We demonstrate the
promise of our new techniques on the MNIST data set.

density profiles within contracted lattices, radial cut angles in lattices, and

infinite and have trivial rigid kernel. We also put strict bounds on the branch
kernel. Additionally, we show that these groups have subgroups of finite index

kernel is non-trivial is the Hanoi towers group and so this adds infinitely
many new examples. Finally, we show that the topological closures of these

characterize such systems photometrically, we observed light curves in white
light, each spanning several hours, at Bronberg Observatory, South Africa, in
2004 and 2005, and at the ObservatÃ³rio do Pico dos Dias, Brazil, in 2014 and
2016. These data permit to study orbital modulations and their variations from
season to season. The orbital period, already known from spectroscopic
observations of Peters & Thorstensen (2005), is confirmed through strong
ellipsoidal variations of the mass donor star in the system and the presence of
eclipses of both components. A refined period of 0.34723972~(6) days and
revised ephemeris are derived. Seasonal changes in the average orbital light
curve can qualitatively be explained by variations of the contribution of a hot
spot to the system light together with changes of the disk radius. The
amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations and the eclipse contact phases permit
to put some constraints on the mass ratio, orbital inclination and the relative
brightness of the primary and secondary components. There are some indications
that the disk radius during quiescence, expressed in units of the component
separation, is smaller than in other dwarf novae.

21393,Network Structure Explains the Impact of Attitudes on Voting Decisions,"  Attitudes can have a profound impact on socially relevant behaviours, such as
voting. However, this effect is not uniform across situations or individuals,
and it is at present difficult to predict whether attitudes will predict
behaviour in any given circumstance. Using a network model, we demonstrate that
(a) more strongly connected attitude networks have a stronger impact on
behaviour, and (b) within any given attitude network, the most central attitude
elements have the strongest impact. We test these hypotheses using data on
voting and attitudes toward presidential candidates in the US presidential
elections from 1980 to 2012. These analyses confirm that the predictive value
of attitude networks depends almost entirely on their level of connectivity,
with more central attitude elements having stronger impact. The impact of
attitudes on voting behaviour can thus be reliably determined before elections

allow for dependence of each observation on a growing number of other units as
sample size increases. We are not aware of any previous methods for inference
about network members in observational settings that allow the number of ties
per node to increase as the network grows. While previous methods have
generally implicitly focused on one of two possible sources of dependence among
social network observations, we allow for both dependence due to contagion, or
transmission of information across network ties, and for dependence due to
latent similarities among nodes sharing ties. We describe estimation and
inference for causal effects that are specifically of interest in social
network settings.

Results demonstrate the applicability of this program for calculating amorphous

21397,Unsupervised Adaptation with Domain Separation Networks for Robust Speech Recognition,"  Unsupervised domain adaptation of speech signal aims at adapting a
well-trained source-domain acoustic model to the unlabeled data from target
domain. This can be achieved by adversarial training of deep neural network
(DNN) acoustic models to learn an intermediate deep representation that is both
senone-discriminative and domain-invariant. Specifically, the DNN is trained to
jointly optimize the primary task of senone classification and the secondary
task of domain classification with adversarial objective functions. In this
work, instead of only focusing on learning a domain-invariant feature (i.e. the
shared component between domains), we also characterize the difference between
the source and target domain distributions by explicitly modeling the private
component of each domain through a private component extractor DNN. The private
component is trained to be orthogonal with the shared component and thus
implicitly increases the degree of domain-invariance of the shared component. A
reconstructor DNN is used to reconstruct the original speech feature from the
private and shared components as a regularization. This domain separation
framework is applied to the unsupervised environment adaptation task and
achieved 11.08% relative WER reduction from the gradient reversal layer
training, a representative adversarial training method, for automatic speech

21398,Robust Power System Dynamic State Estimator with Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise: Part I--Theory,"  This paper develops the theoretical framework and the equations of a new
robust Generalized Maximum-likelihood-type Unscented Kalman Filter (GM-UKF)
that is able to suppress observation and innovation outliers while filtering
out non-Gaussian measurement noise. Because the errors of the real and reactive
power measurements calculated using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) follow
long-tailed probability distributions, the conventional UKF provides strongly
biased state estimates since it relies on the weighted least squares estimator.
By contrast, the state estimates and residuals of our GM-UKF are proved to be
roughly Gaussian, allowing the sigma points to reliably approximate the mean
and the covariance matrices of the predicted and corrected state vectors. To
develop our GM-UKF, we first derive a batch-mode regression form by processing
the predictions and observations simultaneously, where the statistical
linearization approach is used. We show that the set of equations so derived
are equivalent to those of the unscented transformation. Then, a robust
GM-estimator that minimizes a convex Huber cost function while using weights
calculated via Projection Statistics (PS's) is proposed. The PS's are applied
to a two-dimensional matrix that consists of serially correlated predicted
state and innovation vectors to detect observation and innovation outliers.
These outliers are suppressed by the GM-estimator using the iteratively
reweighted least squares algorithm. Finally, the asymptotic error covariance
matrix of the GM-UKF state estimates is derived from the total influence
function. In the companion paper, extensive simulation results will be shown to
verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

symplectic manifold. The particular cases of this result are the algebraic
version of the transversal index theorem related to the theorem of A. Connes

21400,Partially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) Method for Turbulence Simulations: Near-wall Modeling and Smooth-surface Separation Computations,"  The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the PANS model capabilities
in providing significant improvement over RANS predictions at slightly higher
computational expense and producing LES quality results at significantly lower
computational cost. The objectives of this study are: (i) investigate the model
fidelity at a fixed level of scale resolution (Generation1-PANS/G1-PANS) for
smooth surface separation, (ii) Derive the PANS closure model in regions of
resolution variation (Generation2-PANS/G2-PANS), and (iii) Validate G2-PANS
model for attached and separated flows. The separated flows considered in this
study have been designated as critical benchmark flows by NASA CFD study group.
The key contributions of this dissertation are summarized as follows. The
turbulence closure model of varying resolution, G2-PANS, is developed by
deriving mathematically-consistent commutation residues and using energy
conservation principles. The log-layer recovery and accurate computation of
Reynolds stress anisotropy is accomplished by transitioning from steady RANS to
scaled resolved simulations using the G2-PANS model. Finally, several
smooth-separation flows on the NASA turbulence website have been computed with
high degree of accuracy at a significantly reduced computational effort over
LES using the G1-PANS and G2-PANS models.

21401,Stochastic Approximation of Smooth and Strongly Convex Functions: Beyond the $O(1/T)$ Convergence Rate,"  Stochastic approximation (SA) is a classical approach for stochastic convex
optimization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of
SA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity
condition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity
simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\lambda$ be the modulus of
strong convexity, $\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk,
and $\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in
expectation, an $O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha] + \kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is
attainable when $T = \Omega(\kappa^\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the
convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\lambda T])$ and approaches
$O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from
small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound
is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching
$O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we
emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with
an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.

21402,A new approach to hierarchical data analysis: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for the causal effect of a cluster-level exposure,"  We often seek to estimate the impact of an exposure naturally occurring or
randomly assigned at the cluster-level. For example, the literature on
neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community
randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation,
sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven
individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are
correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well
as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and
efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two
targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed
under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions
between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct
transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's
covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE
is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and
individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding.
Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential
gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during
estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that
estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in
an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation
is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We
illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.

21403,Excitation spectrum and Density Matrix Renormalization Group iterations,"  We show that, in certain circumstances, exact excitation energies appear as
locally site-independent (or flat) modes if one records the excitation spectrum
of the effective Hamiltonian while sweeping through the lattice in the
variational Matrix Product State formulation of the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG), a remarkable property since the effective
Hamiltonian is only constructed to target the ground state. Conversely, modes
that are very flat over several consecutive iterations are systematically found
to correspond to faithful excitations. We suggest to use this property to
extract accurate information about excited states using the standard ground
state algorithm. The results are spectacular for critical systems, for which
the low-energy conformal tower of states can be obtained very accurately at
essentially no additional cost, as demonstrated by confirming the predictions
of boundary conformal field theory for two simple minimal models - the
transverse-field Ising model and the critical three-state Potts model. This
approach is also very efficient to detect the quasi-degenerate low-energy
excitations in topological phases, and to identify localized excitations in
systems with impurities. Finally, using the variance of the Hamiltonian as a
criterion, we assess the accuracy of the resulting Matrix Product State
representations of the excited states.

21404,Minimax estimation in linear models with unknown finite alphabet design,"  We provide minimax theory for joint estimation of $F$ and $\omega$ in linear
models $Y = F \omega + Z$ where the parameter matrix $\omega$ and the design
matrix $F$ are unknown but the latter takes values in a known finite set. We
show that this allows to separate $F$ and $\omega$ uniquely under weak
identifiability conditions, a task which is not doable, in general. These
assumptions are justified in a variety of applications, ranging from signal
processing to cancer genetics. We then obtain in the noiseless case, that is,
$Z = 0$, stable recovery of $F$ and $\omega$ in a neighborhood of $Y$. Based on
this, we show for Gaussian error matrix $Z$ that the LSE attains minimax rates
for both, prediction error of $F \omega$ and estimation error of $F$ and
$\omega$, separately. Due to the finite alphabet, estimation of $F$ amounts to
a classification problem, where we show that the classification error
$P(\hat{F} \neq F)$ decreases exponentially in the dimension of one component
of $Y$.

plain FasterRCNN to obtain state-of-the-art results on the Caltech dataset.
To achieve further improvement from more and better data, we introduce
CityPersons, a new set of person annotations on top of the Cityscapes dataset.
The diversity of CityPersons allows us for the first time to train one single
CNN model that generalizes well over multiple benchmarks. Moreover, with
additional training with CityPersons, we obtain top results using FasterRCNN on
Caltech, improving especially for more difficult cases (heavy occlusion and
small scale) and providing higher localization quality.

21408,Coulomb GANs: Provably Optimal Nash Equilibria via Potential Fields,"  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) evolved into one of the most
successful unsupervised techniques for generating realistic images. Even though
it has recently been shown that GAN training converges, GAN models often end up
in local Nash equilibria that are associated with mode collapse or otherwise
fail to model the target distribution. We introduce Coulomb GANs, which pose
the GAN learning problem as a potential field of charged particles, where
generated samples are attracted to training set samples but repel each other.
The discriminator learns a potential field while the generator decreases the
energy by moving its samples along the vector (force) field determined by the
gradient of the potential field. Through decreasing the energy, the GAN model
learns to generate samples according to the whole target distribution and does
not only cover some of its modes. We prove that Coulomb GANs possess only one
Nash equilibrium which is optimal in the sense that the model distribution
equals the target distribution. We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on a
variety of image datasets. On LSUN and celebA, Coulomb GANs set a new state of
the art and produce a previously unseen variety of different samples.

21409,Involution on pseudoisotopy spaces and the space of the nonnegatively curved metrics,"  We prove that certain involutions defined by Vogell and Burghelea-Fiedorowicz

compute the positive and negative eigenspaces of the involution on rational
homotopy groups of pseudoisotopy spaces from the involution on rational
$S^{1}$--homology group of the free loop space of a simply-connected manifold.
As an application, we give explicit dimensions of the open manifolds $V$ that
appear in Belegradek-Farrell-Kapovitch's work for which the spaces of complete
nonnegatively curved metrics on $V$ have nontrivial rational homotopy groups.

this way, more examples of semisimple Hopf actions which do not factor through

21412,Nonequilibrium steady states and transient dynamics of conventional superconductors under phonon driving,"  We perform a systematic analysis of the influence of phonon driving on the
superconducting Holstein model coupled to heat baths by studying both the
transient dynamics and the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) in the weak and
strong electron-phonon coupling regimes. Our study is based on the
nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, and for the NESS we present a
Floquet formulation adapted to electron-phonon systems. The analysis of the
phonon propagator suggests that the effective attractive interaction can be
strongly enhanced in a parametric resonant regime because of the Floquet side
bands of phonons. While this may be expected to enhance the superconductivity
(SC), our fully self-consistent calculations, which include the effects of
heating and nonthermal distributions, show that the parametric phonon driving
generically results in a suppression or complete melting of the SC order. In
the strong coupling regime, the NESS always shows a suppression of the SC gap,
the SC order parameter and the superfluid density as a result of the driving,
and this tendency is most prominent at the parametric resonance. Using the
real-time nonequilibrium DMFT formalism, we also study the dynamics towards the
NESS, which shows that the heating effect dominates the transient dynamics, and
SC is weakened by the external modulations, in particular at the parametric
resonance. In the weak coupling regime, we find that the SC fluctuations above
the transition temperature are generally weakened under the driving. The
strongest suppression occurs again around the parametric resonances because of
the efficient energy absorption.

21413,Optimal Portfolio in Intraday Electricity Markets Modelled by LÃ©vy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes,"  We study an optimal portfolio problem designed for an agent operating in
intraday electricity markets. The investor is allowed to trade in a single
risky asset modelling the continuously traded power and aims to maximize the
expected terminal utility of his wealth. We assume a mean-reverting additive
process to drive the power prices. In the case of logarithmic utility, we
reduce the fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to a linear
parabolic integro-differential equation, for which we explicitly exhibit a
classical solution in two cases of modelling interest. The optimal strategy is
given implicitly as the solution of an integral equation, which is possible to
solve numerically as well as to describe analytically. An analysis of two
different approximations for the optimal policy is provided. Finally, we
perform a numerical test by adapting the parameters of a popular electricity
spot price model.

21414,Topological phase transitions in small mesoscopic chiral p-wave superconductors,"  Spin-triplet chiral p-wave superconductivity is typically described by a
two-component order parameter, and as such is prone to unique emergent effects
when compared to the standard single-component superconductors. Here we present
the equilibrium phase diagram for small mesoscopic chiral p-wave
superconducting disks in the presence of magnetic field, obtained by solving
the microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently. In the
ultra-small limit, the cylindrically-symmetric giant-vortex states are the
ground state of the system. However, with increasing sample size, the
cylindrical symmetry is broken as the two components of the order parameter
segregate into domains, and the number of fragmented domain walls between them
characterizes the resulting states. Such domain walls are topological defects
unique for the p-wave order, and constitute a dominant phase in the mesoscopic
regime. Moreover, we find two possible types of domain walls, identified by
their chirality-dependent interaction with the edge states.

21415,Squeezing on momentum states for atom interferometry,"  We propose and analyse a method that allows for the production of squeezed
states of the atomic center-of-mass motion that can be injected into an atom
interferometer. Our scheme employs dispersive probing in a ring resonator on a
narrow transition of strontium atoms in order to provide a collective
measurement of the relative population of two momentum states. We show that
this method is applicable to a Bragg diffraction-based atom interferometer with
large diffraction orders. The applicability of this technique can be extended
also to small diffraction orders and large atom numbers by inducing atomic
transparency at the frequency of the probe field, reaching an interferometer
phase resolution scaling $\Delta\phi\sim N^{-3/4}$, where $N$ is the atom
number. We show that for realistic parameters it is possible to obtain a 20 dB
gain in interferometer phase estimation compared to the Standard Quantum Limit.

21416,Synthesis of Near-regular Natural Textures,"  Texture synthesis is widely used in the field of computer graphics, vision,
and image processing. In the present paper, a texture synthesis algorithm is
proposed for near-regular natural textures with the help of a representative
periodic pattern extracted from the input textures using distance matching
function. Local texture statistics is then analyzed against global texture
statistics for non-overlapping windows of size same as periodic pattern size
and a representative periodic pattern is extracted from the image and used for
texture synthesis, while preserving the global regularity and visual
appearance. Validation of the algorithm based on experiments with synthetic
textures whose periodic pattern sizes are known and containing camouflages /
defects proves the strength of the algorithm for texture synthesis and its
application in detection of camouflages / defects in textures.

21417,The Uncertainty Bellman Equation and Exploration,"  We consider the exploration/exploitation problem in reinforcement learning.
For exploitation, it is well known that the Bellman equation connects the value
at any time-step to the expected value at subsequent time-steps. In this paper
we consider a similar \textit{uncertainty} Bellman equation (UBE), which
connects the uncertainty at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at
subsequent time-steps, thereby extending the potential exploratory benefit of a
policy beyond individual time-steps. We prove that the unique fixed point of
the UBE yields an upper bound on the variance of the posterior distribution of
the Q-values induced by any policy. This bound can be much tighter than
traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard deviation rather than
variance. Importantly, and unlike several existing approaches to optimism, this
method scales naturally to large systems with complex generalization.
Substituting our UBE-exploration strategy for $\epsilon$-greedy improves DQN
performance on 51 out of 57 games in the Atari suite.

21418,Syntax-Preserving Belief Change Operators for Logic Programs,"  Recent methods have adapted the well-established AGM and belief base
frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In
this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic
programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the
rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches
that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the
latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties
for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial
meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which
allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and
support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more
information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones,
but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the
first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the
revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to
the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the
belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our
operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a
logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions
to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program.
Finally, we compare our approach to two state-of-the-art logic program revision
methods and demonstrate that our operators address the shortcomings of one and
generalise the other method.

degree $deg f\equiv \overline{deg}\psi$ $(|\pi_1(N)|)$ where $0\le
\overline{deg}\psi <|\pi_1(N)|$ and $\overline{deg}\psi$ only depends on the
induced homomorphism $\psi=f_{\pi}$ on the fundamental group. In this paper, we
calculate explicitly the set $\{\overline{deg}\psi\}$ when $\psi$ is surjective
and then we show how to determine $\overline{deg}(\psi)$ for arbitrary
homomorphisms. This leads to the determination of the set $D(M,N)$.

21420,Estimating graph parameters with random walks,"  An algorithm observes the trajectories of random walks over an unknown graph
$G$, starting from the same vertex $x$, as well as the degrees along the
trajectories. For all finite connected graphs, one can estimate the number of
edges $m$ up to a bounded factor in
$O\left(t_{\mathrm{rel}}^{3/4}\sqrt{m/d}\right)$ steps, where
$t_{\mathrm{rel}}$ is the relaxation time of the lazy random walk on $G$ and
$d$ is the minimum degree in $G$. Alternatively, $m$ can be estimated in
$O\left(t_{\mathrm{unif}} +t_{\mathrm{rel}}^{5/6}\sqrt{n}\right)$, where $n$ is
the number of vertices and $t_{\mathrm{unif}}$ is the uniform mixing time on
$G$. The number of vertices $n$ can then be estimated up to a bounded factor in
an additional $O\left(t_{\mathrm{unif}}\frac{m}{n}\right)$ steps. Our
algorithms are based on counting the number of intersections of random walk
paths $X,Y$, i.e. the number of pairs $(t,s)$ such that $X_t=Y_s$. This
improves on previous estimates which only consider collisions (i.e., times $t$
with $X_t=Y_t$). We also show that the complexity of our algorithms is optimal,
even when restricting to graphs with a prescribed relaxation time. Finally, we
show that, given either $m$ or the mixing time of $G$, we can compute the
""other parameter"" with a self-stopping algorithm.

21421,RoI-based Robotic Grasp Detection in Object Overlapping Scenes Using Convolutional Neural Network,"  Grasp detection is an essential skill for widespread use of robots. Recent
works demonstrate the advanced performance of Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) on robotic grasp detection. However, a significant shortcoming of
existing grasp detection algorithms is that they all ignore the affiliation
between grasps and targets. In this paper, we propose a robotic grasp detection
algorithm based on Region of Interest (RoI) to simultaneously detect targets
and their grasps in object overlapping scenes. Our proposed algorithm uses
Regions of Interest (RoIs) to detect grasps while doing classification and
location regression of targets. To train the network, we contribute a much
bigger multi-object grasp dataset than Cornell Grasp Dataset, which is based on
Visual Manipulation Relationship Dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
our algorithm achieves 24.9% miss rate at 1FPPI and 68.2% mAP with grasp on our
dataset. Robotic experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can help
robots grasp specified target in multi-object scenes at 84% success rate.

21422,Light Source Point Cluster Selection Based Atmosphere Light Estimation,"  Atmosphere light value is a highly critical parameter in defogging algorithms
that are based on an atmosphere scattering model. Any error in atmosphere light
value will produce a direct impact on the accuracy of scattering computation
and thus bring chromatic distortion to restored images. To address this
problem, this paper propose a method that relies on clustering statistics to
estimate atmosphere light value. It starts by selecting in the original image
some potential atmosphere light source points, which are grouped into point
clusters by means of clustering technique. From these clusters, a number of
clusters containing candidate atmosphere light source points are selected, the
points are then analyzed statistically, and the cluster containing the most
candidate points is used for estimating atmosphere light value. The mean
brightness vector of the candidate atmosphere light points in the chosen point
cluster is taken as the estimate of atmosphere light value, while their
geometric center in the image is accepted as the location of atmosphere light.
Experimental results suggest that this statistics clustering method produces
more accurate atmosphere brightness vectors and light source locations. This
accuracy translates to, from a subjective perspective, more natural defogging
effect on the one hand and to the improvement in various objective image
quality indicators on the other hand.

21424,Physics-guided probabilistic modeling of extreme precipitation under climate change,"  Earth System Models (ESMs) are the state of the art for projecting the
effects of climate change. However, longstanding uncertainties in their ability
to simulate regional and local precipitation extremes and related processes
inhibit decision making. Stakeholders would be best supported by probabilistic
projections of changes in extreme precipitation at relevant space-time scales.
Here we propose an empirical Bayesian model that extends an existing skill and
consensus based weighting framework and test the hypothesis that nontrivial,
physics-guided measures of ESM skill can help produce reliable probabilistic
characterization of climate extremes. Specifically, the model leverages
knowledge of physical relationships between temperature, atmospheric moisture
capacity, and extreme precipitation intensity to iteratively weight and combine
ESMs and estimate probability distributions of return levels. Out-of-sample
validation shows evidence that the Bayesian model is a sound method for
deriving reliable probabilistic projections. Beyond precipitation extremes, the
framework may be a basis for a generic, physics-guided approach to modeling
probability distributions of climate variables in general, extremes or
otherwise.

pre-stressed granules. The PDE in question supports solitary waves of
compression and rarefaction (bright and dark compactons) and can be written in
Hamiltonian form. We investigate {\em inter alia} integrability properties of
this PDE and its generalized symmetries and conservation laws.
For the compacton solutions we perform a stability test followed by the
numerical study. In particular, we simulate the temporal evolution of a single

21427,FormuLog: Datalog for static analysis involving logical formulae,"  Datalog has become a popular language for writing static analyses. Because
Datalog is very limited, some implementations of Datalog for static analysis
have extended it with new language features. However, even with these features
it is hard or impossible to express a large class of analyses because they use
logical formulae to represent program state. FormuLog fills this gap by
extending Datalog to represent, manipulate, and reason about logical formulae.
We have used FormuLog to implement declarative versions of symbolic execution
and abstract model checking, analyses previously out of the scope of
Datalog-based languages. While this paper focuses on the design of FormuLog and
one of the analyses we have implemented in it, it also touches on a prototype
implementation of the language and identifies performance optimizations that we
believe will be necessary to scale FormuLog to real-world static analysis
problems.

21429,Heat flows inferred from a Parker's-like formula for stable or quasi-stable continents,"  Surface heat flow is a key parameter for the geothermal structure, rheology,
and hence the dynamics of continents. However, the coverage of heat flow
measurements is still poor in many continental areas. By transforming the
stable nonlinear heat conduction equation into a Poisson's one, we develop a
method to infer surface heat flow for a stable or quasi-stable continent from a
Parker's-like formula. This formula provides the relationship between the
Fourier transform of surface heat flow and the sum of the Fourier transform of
the powers of geometry for the heat production (HP) interface in the
continental lithosphere. Once the interface geometry is known, one to three
dimensional distribution of the surface heat flow can be calculated accurately
by this formula. As a case study, we estimate the three-dimensional surface
heat flows for the Ordos geological block and its adjacent areas in China on a
$1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ grid based on a simple layered constant HP model.
Comparing to the measurements, most relative errors of the heat flows inferred
are less than 20\%, showing this method is a favorable way to estimate surface
heat flow for stable or quasi-stable continental regions where measurements are
rare or absent.

21430,Real-time 3D Reconstruction on Construction Site using Visual SLAM and UAV,"  3D reconstruction can be used as a platform to monitor the performance of
activities on construction site, such as construction progress monitoring,
structure inspection and post-disaster rescue. Comparing to other sensors, RGB
image has the advantages of low-cost, texture rich and easy to implement that
has been used as the primary method for 3D reconstruction in construction
industry. However, the image-based 3D reconstruction always requires extended
time to acquire and/or to process the image data, which limits its application
on time critical projects. Recent progress in Visual Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) make it possible to reconstruct a 3D map of construction
site in real-time. Integrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the obstacles
areas that are inaccessible for the ground equipment can also be sensed.
Despite these advantages of visual SLAM and UAV, until now, such technique has
not been fully investigated on construction site. Therefore, the objective of
this research is to present a pilot study of using visual SLAM and UAV for
real-time construction site reconstruction. The system architecture and the
experimental setup are introduced, and the preliminary results and the
potential applications using Visual SLAM and UAV on construction site are
discussed.

21431,The Space of Transferable Adversarial Examples,"  Adversarial examples are maliciously perturbed inputs designed to mislead
machine learning (ML) models at test-time. They often transfer: the same
adversarial example fools more than one model.
In this work, we propose novel methods for estimating the previously unknown
dimensionality of the space of adversarial inputs. We find that adversarial
examples span a contiguous subspace of large (~25) dimensionality. Adversarial
subspaces with higher dimensionality are more likely to intersect. We find that
for two different models, a significant fraction of their subspaces is shared,
thus enabling transferability.
In the first quantitative analysis of the similarity of different models'
decision boundaries, we show that these boundaries are actually close in
arbitrary directions, whether adversarial or benign. We conclude by formally
studying the limits of transferability. We derive (1) sufficient conditions on
the data distribution that imply transferability for simple model classes and
(2) examples of scenarios in which transfer does not occur. These findings
indicate that it may be possible to design defenses against transfer-based
attacks, even for models that are vulnerable to direct attacks.

21432,Sensitivity of the entanglement spectrum to boundary conditions as a characterization of the phase transition from delocalization to localization,"  Sensitivity of entanglement Hamiltonian spectrum to boundary conditions is
considered as a phase detection parameter for delocalized-localized phase
transition. By employing one-dimensional models that undergo
delocalized-localized phase transition, we study the shift in the entanglement
energies and the shift in the entanglement entropy when we change boundary
conditions from periodic to anti-periodic. Specifically, we show that both
these quantities show a change of several orders of magnitude at the transition
point in the models considered. Therefore, this shift can be used to indicate
the phase transition points in the models. We also show that both these
quantities can be used to determine \emph{mobility edges} separating localized
and delocalized states.

not pristine, as it is continuously enriched by metals synthesised in Type Ia

responsible for releasing and mixing the metals can be probed via the radial

deep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations from a sample of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy
clusters, groups, and ellipticals (CHEERS) to constrain the average radial O,
Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni abundance profiles. The radial distributions of
all these elements, averaged over a large sample for the first time, represent
the best constrained profiles available currently. We find an overall decrease
of the Fe abundance with radius out to ~$0.9 r_{500}$ and ~$0.6 r_{500}$ for
clusters and groups, respectively, in good agreement with predictions from the
most recent hydrodynamical simulations. The average radial profiles of all the
other elements (X) are also centrally peaked and, when rescaled to their
average central X/Fe ratios, follow well the Fe profile out to at least
~0.5$r_{500}$. Using two sets of SNIa and SNcc yield models reproducing well
the X/Fe abundance pattern in the core, we find that, as predicted by recent
simulations, the relative contribution of SNIa (SNcc) to the total ICM
enrichment is consistent with being uniform at all radii, both for clusters and
groups. In addition to implying that the central metal peak is balanced between
SNIa and SNcc, our results suggest that the enriching SNIa and SNcc products
must share the same origin, and that the delay between the bulk of the SNIa and
SNcc explosions must be shorter than the timescale necessary to diffuse out the
metals.

21434,Edge states in dynamical superlattices,"  We address edge states and rich localization regimes available in the
one-dimensional (1D) dynamically modulated superlattices, both theoretically
and numerically. In contrast to conventional lattices with straight waveguides,
the quasi-energy band of infinite modulated superlattice is periodic not only
in the transverse Bloch momentum, but it also changes periodically with
increase of the coupling strength between waveguides. Due to collapse of
quasi-energy bands dynamical superlattices admit known dynamical localization
effect. If, however, such a lattice is truncated, periodic longitudinal
modulation leads to appearance of specific edge states that exist within
certain periodically spaced intervals of coupling constants. We discuss unusual
transport properties of such truncated superlattices and illustrate different
excitation regimes and enhanced robustness of edge states in them, that is
associated with topology of the quasi-energy band.

21435,"On the Monitoring of Decentralized Specifications Semantics, Properties, Analysis, and Simulation","  We define two complementary approaches to monitor decentralized systems. The
first relies on those with a centralized specification, i.e, when the
specification is written for the behavior of the entire system. To do so, our
approach introduces a data-structure that i) keeps track of the execution of an
automaton, ii) has predictable parameters and size, and iii) guarantees strong
eventual consistency. The second approach defines decentralized specifications
wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system.
We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to
monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We
also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications.
We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for
analyzing their behavior. Furthermore, we introduce THEMIS, a framework for
designing such decentralized algorithms and simulating their behavior. We show
the usage of THEMIS to compare multiple algorithms and verify the trends
predicted by the analysis by studying two scenarios: a synthetic benchmark and
a real example.

21436,Morphology and the Color-Mass Diagram as Clues to Galaxy Evolution at z~1,"  We study the significance of mergers in the quenching of star formation in
galaxies at z~1 by examining their color-mass distributions for different
morphology types. We perform two-dimensional light profile fits to GOODS iz
images of ~5000 galaxies and X-ray selected active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts
in the CANDELS/GOODS-north and south fields in the redshift range 0.7<z<1.3.
Distinguishing between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated morphologies, we find
that disks and spheroids have distinct color-mass distributions, in agreement
with studies at z~0. The smooth distribution across colors for the disk
galaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event.
Meanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming
disk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is
suggestive of rapid quenching. The distribution of moderate luminosity X-ray
AGN hosts is even across colors, in contrast, and we find similar numbers and
distributions among the two morphology types with no apparent dependence on
Eddington ratio. The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN
in the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the
AGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves
into the green valley. This suggests AGN feedback may play a role in the
quenching of star formation in the minority of galaxies that undergo major
mergers.

21437,That's Mine! Learning Ownership Relations and Norms for Robots,"  The ability for autonomous agents to learn and conform to human norms is
crucial for their safety and effectiveness in social environments. While recent
work has led to frameworks for the representation and inference of simple
social rules, research into norm learning remains at an exploratory stage.
Here, we present a robotic system capable of representing, learning, and
inferring ownership relations and norms. Ownership is represented as a graph of
probabilistic relations between objects and their owners, along with a database
of predicate-based norms that constrain the actions permissible on owned
objects. To learn these norms and relations, our system integrates (i) a novel
incremental norm learning algorithm capable of both one-shot learning and
induction from specific examples, (ii) Bayesian inference of ownership
relations in response to apparent rule violations, and (iii) percept-based
prediction of an object's likely owners. Through a series of simulated and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate the competence and flexibility of the
system in performing object manipulation tasks that require a variety of norms
to be followed, laying the groundwork for future research into the acquisition
and application of social norms.

21438,Understanding liquid-jet atomization cascades via vortex dynamics,"  Temporal instabilities of a planar liquid jet are studied using direct
numerical simulation (DNS) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with
level-set (LS) and volume-of-fluid (VoF) surface tracking methods. $\lambda_2$
contours are used to relate the vortex dynamics to the surface dynamics at
different stages of the jet breakup, namely, lobe formation, lobe perforation,
ligament formation, stretching, and tearing. Three distinct breakup mechanisms
are identified in the primary breakup, which are well categorized on the
parameter space of gas Weber number ($We_g$) versus liquid Reynolds number
($Re_l$). These mechanisms are analyzed here from a vortex dynamics
perspective. Vortex dynamics explains the hairpin formation, and the
interaction between the hairpins and the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roller explains
the perforation of the lobes, which is attributed to the streamwise overlapping
of two oppositely-oriented hairpin vortices on top and bottom of the lobe. The
formation of corrugations on the lobe front edge at high $Re_l$ is also related
to the location and structure of the hairpins with respect to the KH vortex.
The lobe perforation and corrugation formation are inhibited at low $Re_l$ and
low $We_g$ due to the high surface tension and viscous forces, which damp the
small scale corrugations and resist hole formation. Streamwise vorticity
generation - resulting in three-dimensional instabilities - is mainly caused by
vortex stretching and baroclinic torque at high and low density ratios,
respectively. Generation of streamwise vortices and their interaction with
spanwise vortices produce the liquid structures seen at various flow
conditions. Understanding the liquid sheet breakup and the related vortex
dynamics are crucial for controlling the droplet size distribution in primary
atomization.

21439,Multi-kernel learning of deep convolutional features for action recognition,"  Image understanding using deep convolutional network has reached human-level
performance, yet a closely related problem of video understanding especially,
action recognition has not reached the requisite level of maturity. We combine
multi-kernels based support-vector-machines (SVM) with a multi-stream deep
convolutional neural network to achieve close to state-of-the-art performance
on a 51-class activity recognition problem (HMDB-51 dataset); this specific
dataset has proved to be particularly challenging for deep neural networks due
to the heterogeneity in camera viewpoints, video quality, etc. The resulting
architecture is named pillar networks as each (very) deep neural network acts
as a pillar for the hierarchical classifiers. In addition, we illustrate that
hand-crafted features such as improved dense trajectories (iDT) and Multi-skip
Feature Stacking (MIFS), as additional pillars, can further supplement the
performance.

21440,"Vector bundles for ""Matrix algebras converge to the sphere""","  In the high-energy quantum-physics literature one finds statements such as
""matrix algebras converge to the sphere"". Earlier I provided a general precise
setting for understanding such statements, in which the matrix algebras are
viewed as quantum metric spaces, and convergence is with respect to a quantum
Gromov-Hausdorff-type distance.
But physicists want even more to treat structures on spheres (and other
spaces), such as vector bundles, Yang-Mills functionals, Dirac operators, etc.,
and they want to approximate these by corresponding structures on matrix
algebras. In the present paper we treat this idea for vector bundles. We
develop a general precise way for understanding how, for two compact quantum
metric spaces that are close together, to a given vector bundle on one of them
there can correspond in a natural way a unique vector bundle on the other. We
then show explicitly how this works for the case of matrix algebras converging
to the 2-sphere.

Ga(Al)As(111)A surfaces. We develop a theoretical growth model that well
describes the observed behavior on the growth parameters and underlines the
Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier as leading factor that determines the growth
dynamics. On such basis we analyze the factors that lead to the huge observed
roughness on such surface orientations and we identify the growth conditions
that drive the typical three-dimensional growth of Ga(Al)As(111)A towards
atomically flat surface. GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells realized on optimized
surface (<0.2 nm roughness) show a record low emission linewidth of 4.5 meV.

21442,Warnings and Caveats in Brain Controllability,"  In this work we challenge the main conclusions of Gu et al work
(Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6, 8414,
doi:10.1038/ncomms9414, 2015) on brain controllability. Using the same methods
and analyses on four datasets we find that the minimum set of nodes to control
brain networks is always larger than one. We also find that the relationships
between the average/modal controllability and weighted degrees also hold for
randomized data and the there are not specific roles played by Resting State
Networks in controlling the brain. In conclusion, we show that there is no
evidence that topology plays specific and unique roles in the controllability
of brain networks. Accordingly, Gu et al. interpretation of their results, in
particular in terms of translational applications (e.g. using single node
controllability properties to define target region(s) for neurostimulation)
should be revisited. Though theoretically intriguing, our understanding of the
relationship between controllability and structural brain network remains
elusive.

21443,Novelty and Foreseeing Research Trends; The Case of Astrophysics and Astronomy,"  Metrics based on reference lists of research articles or on keywords have
been used to predict citation impact. The concept behind such metrics is that
original ideas stem from the reconfiguration of the structure of past
knowledge, and therefore atypical combinations in the reference lists,
keywords, or classification codes indicate future high impact research. The
current paper serves as an introduction to this line of research for
astronomers and also addresses some methodological questions of this field of
innovation studies. It is still not clear if the choice of particular indexes,
such as references to journals, articles, or specific bibliometric
classification codes would affect the relationship between atypical
combinations and citation impact. To understand more aspects of the innovation
process, a new metric has been devised to measure to what extent researchers
are able to anticipate the changing combinatorial trends of the future. Results
show that the variant of the latter anticipation scores that is based on paper
combinations is a good predictor of future citation impact of scholarly works.
The study also shows that the effect of tested indexes vary with the
aggregation level that was used to construct them. A detailed analysis of
combinatorial novelty in the field reveals that certain sub-fields of astronomy
and astrophysics have different roles in the reconfiguration in past knowledge.

such as a computer processor or a router arbitrated by a round robin policy. We
present an information-theoretic framework to model and derive the maximum
reliable data transmission rate, i.e., the capacity of this channel, for both
noiseless and noisy setups. Our results show that seemingly isolated users can
communicate with a high rate over the covert channel and demonstrate the
possibility of significant information leakage and privacy threats brought by
CQCs in round robin schedulers. Moreover, we propose practical finite-length
code constructions, which achieve the capacity limit.

21445,Relative periodic orbits form the backbone of turbulent pipe flow,"  Chaotic dynamics of low-dimensional systems, such as Lorenz or RÃ¶ssler
flows, is guided by the infinity of periodic orbits embedded in their strange
attractors. Whether this also be the case for the infinite-dimensional dynamics
of Navier--Stokes equations has long been speculated, and is a topic of ongoing
study. Periodic and relative periodic solutions have been shown to be involved
in transitions to turbulence. Their relevance to turbulent
dynamics---specifically, whether periodic orbits play the same role in
high-dimensional nonlinear systems like the Navier--Stokes equations as they do
in lower-dimensional systems---is the focus of the present investigation. We
perform here a detailed study of pipe flow relative periodic orbits with
energies and mean dissipations close to turbulent values. We outline several
approaches to reduction of the translational symmetry of the system. We study
pipe flow in a minimal computational cell, and report a library of invariant
solutions found with the aid of the method of slices. Detailed study of the
unstable manifolds of a sample of these solutions is consistent with the
picture that relative periodic orbits are embedded in the chaotic saddle and
that they guide the turbulent dynamics.

21446,Tunable hybridization of Majorana bound states at the quantum spin Hall edge,"  Confinement at the helical edge of a topological insulator is possible in the
presence of proximity-induced magnetic (F) or superconducting (S) order. The
interplay of both phenomena leads to the formation of localized Majorana bound
states (MBS) or likewise (under certain resonance conditions) the formation of
ordinary Andreev bound states (ABS). We investigate the properties of bound
states in junctions composed of alternating regions of F or S barriers.
Interestingly, the direction of magnetization in F regions and the relative
superconducting phase between S regions can be exploited to hybridize MBS or
ABS at will. We show that the local properties of MBS translate into a
particular nonlocal superconducting pairing amplitude. Remarkably, the symmetry
of the pairing amplitude contains information about the nature of the bound
state that it stems from. Hence, this symmetry can in principle be used to
distinguish MBS from ABS, owing to the strong connection between local density
of states and nonlocal pairing in our setup.

21448,A 20-Channel Magnetoencephalography System Based on Optically Pumped Magnetometers,"  We describe a multichannel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system that uses

human subject's head, a person-sized magnetic shield containing the array and
the human subject, a laser system to drive the OPM array, and various control

evoked magnetic field (AEF) and somatosensory evoked magnetic field (SEF), on
three healthy male subjects, using both our OPM array and a 306-channel
Elekta-Neuromag superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) MEG system.
The described OPM array measures the tangential components of the magnetic

systems. Herein we compare the results of the OPM- and SQUID-based MEG systems
on the auditory and somatosensory data recorded in the same individuals on both
systems.

21449,A universal negative group delay filter for the prediction of band-limited signals,"  A filter for universal real-time prediction of band-limited signals is
presented. The filter consists of multiple time-delayed feedback terms in order
to accomplish anticipatory coupling, which again leads to a negative group
delay for frequencies in the baseband. The universality of the filter arises
from its property that it does not rely on a specific model of the signal.
Specifically, as long as the signal to be predicted is band-limited with a
known cutoff frequency, the filter order, the only parameter of the filter,
follows and the filter predicts the signal in real time up to a prediction
horizon that depends on the cutoff frequency, too. It is worked out in detail
how signal prediction arises from the negative group delay of the filter. Its
properties, including stability, are investigated theoretically, by numerical
simulations, and by application to a physiological signal. Possible control and
signal processing applications of this filter are discussed.

21450,The odd primary order of the commutator on low rank Lie groups,"  Let $G$ be a simply-connected, compact, simple Lie group of low rank relative
to a fixed prime $p$. After localization at $p$, there is a space $A$ which
""generates"" $G$ in a certain sense. Assuming $G$ satisfies a homotopy
nilpotency condition relative to $p$, we show that the Samelson product
$\langle Id_G, Id_G\rangle$ of the identity of $G$ equals the order of the
Samelson product $\langle\imath,\imath\rangle$ of the inclusion $\imath:A\to
G$. Applying this result, we calculate the orders of $\langle Id_G,Id_G\rangle$
for all $p$-regular Lie groups and give bounds on the orders of $\langle

21451,Communication Complexity of Estimating Correlations,"  We characterize the communication complexity of the following distributed
estimation problem. Alice and Bob observe infinitely many iid copies of
$\rho$-correlated unit-variance (Gaussian or $\pm1$ binary) random variables,
with unknown $\rho\in[-1,1]$. By interactively exchanging $k$ bits, Bob wants
to produce an estimate $\hat\rho$ of $\rho$. We show that the best possible
performance (optimized over interaction protocol $\Pi$ and estimator $\hat
\rho$) satisfies $\inf_{\Pi,\hat\rho}\sup_\rho \mathbb{E} [|\rho-\hat\rho|^2] =
\Theta(\tfrac{1}{k})$. Furthermore, we show that the best possible unbiased
estimator achieves performance of $1+o(1)\over {2k\ln 2}$. Curiously, thus,
restricting communication to $k$ bits results in (order-wise) similar minimax
estimation error as restricting to $k$ samples. Our results also imply an
$\Omega(n)$ lower bound on the information complexity of the Gap-Hamming
problem, for which we show a direct information-theoretic proof.
Notably, the protocol achieving (almost) optimal performance is one-way
(non-interactive). For one-way protocols we also prove the
$\Omega(\tfrac{1}{k})$ bound even when $\rho$ is restricted to any small open
sub-interval of $[-1,1]$ (i.e. a local minimax lower bound). %We do not know if
this local behavior remains true in the interactive setting. Our proof
techniques rely on symmetric strong data-processing inequalities, various
tensorization techniques from information-theoretic interactive
common-randomness extraction, and (for the local lower bound) on the
Otto-Villani estimate for the Wasserstein-continuity of trajectories of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup.

variant of Seldin's strategy for the postponement of raa is proposed, and the
similarities with Prawitz's approach are investigated. In particular, it is
shown that, as for Prawitz, it is possible to use this variant of Seldin's

21453,Inference for the cross-covariance operator of stationary functional time series,"  When considering two or more time series of functions or curves, for instance
those derived from densely observed intraday stock price data of several
companies, the empirical cross-covariance operator is of fundamental importance
due to its role in functional lagged regression and exploratory data analysis.
Despite its relevance, statistical procedures for measuring the significance of
such estimators are undeveloped. We present methodology based on a functional
central limit theorem for conducting statistical inference for the
cross-covariance operator estimated between two stationary, weakly dependent,
functional time series. Specifically, we consider testing the null hypothesis
that two series possess a specified cross-covariance structure at a given lag.
Since this test assumes that the series are jointly stationary, we also develop
a change-point detection procedure to validate this assumption, which is of
independent interest. The most imposing technical hurdle in implementing the
proposed tests involves estimating the spectrum of a high dimensional spectral
density operator at frequency zero. We propose a simple dimension reduction
procedure based on functional PCA to achieve this, which is shown to perform
well in a small simulation study. We illustrate the proposed methodology with
an application to densely observed intraday price data of stocks listed on the
NYSE.

21455,Sufficient conditions for convergence of multiple Fourier series with $J_k$-lacunary sequence of rectangular partial sums in terms of Weyl multipliers,"  We obtain sufficient conditions for convergence (almost everywhere) of
multiple trigonometric Fourier series of functions $f$ in $L_2$ in terms of
Weyl multipliers. We consider the case where rectangular partial sums of
Fourier series $S_n(x;f)$ have indices $n=(n_1,\dots,n_N) \in \mathbb Z^N$,
$N\ge 3$, in which $k$ $(1\leq k\leq N-2)$ components on the places
$\{j_1,\dots,j_k\}=J_k \subset \{1,\dots,N\} = M$ are elements of (single)
lacunary sequences (i.e., we consider the, so called, multiple Fourier series
with $J_k$-lacunary sequence of partial sums). We prove that for any sample
$J_k\subset M$ the Weyl multiplier for convergence of these series has the form
$W(\nu)=\prod \limits_{j=1}^{N-k} \log(|\nu_{{\alpha}_j}|+2)$, where
$\alpha_j\in M\setminus J_k $, $\nu=(\nu_1,\dots,\nu_N)\in{\mathbb Z}^N$. So,
the ""one-dimensional"" Weyl multiplier -- $\log(|\cdot|+2)$ -- presents in
$W(\nu)$ only on the places of ""free"" (nonlacunary) components of the vector
$\nu$. Earlier, in the case where $N-1$ components of the index $n$ are
elements of lacunary sequences, convergence almost everywhere for multiple
Fourier series was obtained in 1977 by M.Kojima in the classes $L_p$, $p>1$,
and by D.K.Sanadze, Sh.V.Kheladze in Orlizc class. Note, that presence of two
or more ""free"" components in the index $n$ (as follows from the results by
Ch.Fefferman (1971)) does not guarantee the convergence almost everywhere of
$S_n(x;f)$ for $N\geq 3$ even in the class of continuous functions.

21457,Synergistic effects in threshold models on networks,"  Network structure can have significant effects on the propagation of
diseases, memes, and information on social networks. Such effects depend on the
specific type of dynamical process that affects the nodes and edges of a
network, and it is important to develop tractable models of spreading processes
on networks to explore how network structure affects dynamics. In this paper,
we incorporate the idea of \emph{synergy} into a two-state (""active"" or
""passive"") threshold model of social influence on networks. Our model's update
rule is deterministic, and the influence of each meme-carrying (i.e., active)
neighbor can --- depending on a parameter --- either be enhanced or inhibited
by an amount that depends on the number of active neighbors of a node. Such a
synergistic system models social behavior in which the willingness to adopt
either accelerates or saturates depending on the number of neighbors who have
adopted that behavior. We illustrate that the synergy parameter in our model
has a crucial effect on system dynamics, as it determines whether degree-$k$
nodes are possible or impossible to activate. We simulate synergistic meme
spreading on both random-graph models and networks constructed from empirical
data. Using a local-tree approximation, we examine the spreading of synergistic
memes and find good agreement on all but one of the networks on which we
simulate spreading. We find for any network and for a broad family of
synergistic models that one can predict which synergy-parameter values allow
degree-$k$ nodes to be activated.

their inference in a manner that prevents overfitting, and enables model

avoid underfitting via increased Bayesian hierarchies, and we contrast the task
of sampling network partitions from the posterior distribution with finding the
single point estimate that maximizes it, while describing efficient algorithms
to perform either one. We also show how inferring the SBM can be used to
predict missing and spurious links, and shed light on the fundamental
limitations of the detectability of modular structures in networks.

The Crane Beach Property (CBP), introduced more than a decade ago, is true of

Although it is known that FO[Arb] does not have the CBP, it is shown here
that the (strong form of the) CBP holds for both FO[<, Fin] and FO[<, MSB$_0$].
Thus FO[<, Fin] exhibits a form of locality and the CBP, and can still express

scattering measurements of the magnetically frustrated compounds
NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$ and NaSrCo$_2$F$_7$, which belong to a class of recently
discovered pyrochlore compounds based on transition metals and fluorine. The
magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) technique is used to analyze and
model the total scattering data in real space. We find that a
previously-proposed model of short-range XY-like correlations with a length
scale of 10-15 \AA, combined with nearest-neighbor collinear antiferromagnetic
correlations, accurately describes the mPDF data at low temperature, confirming
the magnetic ground state in these materials. This model is further verified by
the polarized neutron scattering data. From an analysis of the temperature
dependence of the mPDF and polarized neutron scattering data, we find that
short-range correlations persist on the nearest-neighbor length scale up to 200
K, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the spin freezing
temperatures of these compounds. These results highlight the opportunity
presented by these new pyrochlore compounds to study the effects of geometric
frustration at relatively high temperatures, while also advancing the mPDF

beings. However, when integrating ML models into a system, developers may
accidentally take not enough care of the outputs of ML models, mainly because
of their unfamiliarity with ML and AI, resulting in severe consequences like
hurting data owners' privacy. In this work, we focus on understanding the risks
of abusing embeddings of ML models, an important and popular way of using ML.
To show the consequence, we reveal several kinds of channels in which
embeddings are accidentally leaked. As our study shows, a face verification
system deployed by a government organization leaking only distance to authentic
users allows an attacker to exactly recover the embedding of the verifier's
pre-installed photo. Further, as we discovered, with the leaked embedding,
attackers can easily recover the input photo with negligible quality losses,
indicating devastating consequences to users' privacy. This is achieved with
our devised GAN-like structure model, which showed 93.65% success rate on
popular face embedding model under black box assumption.

21464,Anatomy of an online misinformation network,"  Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over
social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite
intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and
fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of
the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main
purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these
questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic
studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter.
Hoaxy filters public tweets that include links to unverified claims or
fact-checking articles. We perform k-core decomposition on a diffusion network
obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand
accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery
to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots
proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around
the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense
connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be
disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first
look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network.

21465,Injection Bucket Jitter Compensation Using Phase Lock System At Fermilab Booster,"  The extraction bucket position in the Fermilab Booster is controlled with a
cogging process that involves the comparison of the Booster RF count and the
Recycler Ring revolution marker. A one RF bucket jitter in the extraction
bucket position results from the variability of the process that phase matches
the Booster to the Recycler. However, the new slow phase lock process used to
lock the frequency and phase of the Booster RF to the Recycler RF has been made
digital and programmable and has been modified to correct the extraction notch
position. The beam loss at the Recycler injection has been reduced by 20%. Beam
studies and the phase lock system will be discussed in this paper.

21466,Collaborative Deep Learning in Fixed Topology Networks,"  There is significant recent interest to parallelize deep learning algorithms
in order to handle the enormous growth in data and model sizes. While most
advances focus on model parallelization and engaging multiple computing agents
via using a central parameter server, aspect of data parallelization along with
decentralized computation has not been explored sufficiently. In this context,
this paper presents a new consensus-based distributed SGD (CDSGD) (and its
momentum variant, CDMSGD) algorithm for collaborative deep learning over fixed
topology networks that enables data parallelization as well as decentralized
computation. Such a framework can be extremely useful for learning agents with
access to only local/private data in a communication constrained environment.
We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm with strongly
convex and nonconvex objective functions with fixed and diminishing step sizes
using concepts of Lyapunov function construction. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our algorithms in comparison with the baseline centralized SGD and the
recently proposed federated averaging algorithm (that also enables data
parallelism) based on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

21467,Learning Hidden Markov Models from Pairwise Co-occurrences with Application to Topic Modeling,"  We present a new algorithm for identifying the transition and emission
probabilities of a hidden Markov model (HMM) from the emitted data.
Expectation-maximization becomes computationally prohibitive for long
observation records, which are often required for identification. The new
algorithm is particularly suitable for cases where the available sample size is
large enough to accurately estimate second-order output probabilities, but not
higher-order ones. We show that if one is only able to obtain a reliable
estimate of the pairwise co-occurrence probabilities of the emissions, it is
still possible to uniquely identify the HMM if the emission probability is
\emph{sufficiently scattered}. We apply our method to hidden topic Markov
modeling, and demonstrate that we can learn topics with higher quality if
documents are modeled as observations of HMMs sharing the same emission (topic)
probability, compared to the simple but widely used bag-of-words model.

21469,Necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent root reconstruction in Markov models on trees,"  We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent root
reconstruction in continuous-time Markov models with countable state space on
bounded-height trees. Here a root state estimator is said to be consistent if
the probability that it returns to the true root state converges to 1 as the
number of leaves tends to infinity. We also derive quantitative bounds on the
error of reconstruction. Our results answer a question of Gascuel and Steel and
have implications for ancestral sequence reconstruction in a classical
evolutionary model of nucleotide insertion and deletion.

21470,Perfectly Controllable Multi-Agent Networks,"  This note investigates how to design topology structures to ensure the
controllability of multi-agent networks (MASs) under any selection of leaders.
We put forward a concept of perfect controllability, which means that a
multi-agent system is controllable with no matter how the leaders are chosen.
In this situation, both the number and the locations of leader agents are
arbitrary. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the perfect
controllability. Moreover, a step-by-step design procedure is proposed by which
topologies are constructed and are proved to be perfectly controllable. The
principle of the proposed design method is interpreted by schematic diagrams
along with the corresponding topology structures from simple to complex. We
show that the results are valid for any number and any location of leaders.
Both the construction process and the corresponding topology structures are
clearly outlined.

21471,Origin of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies in the Coma Cluster without fine-tuning,"  After thirty years of the discovery of the fundamental plane, explanations to
the tilt of the fundamental plane with respect to the virial plane still suffer
from the need of fine-tuning. In this paper, we try to explore the origin of
this tilt from the perspective of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) by
applying the 16 Coma galaxies available in Thomas et al.[1]. Based on the mass
models that can reproduce de Vaucouleurs' law closely, we find that the tilt of
the traditional fundamental plane is naturally explained by the simple form of
the MONDian interpolating function, if we assume a well motivated choice of
anisotropic velocity distribution, and adopt the Kroupa or Salpeter stellar
mass-to-light ratio. Our analysis does not necessarily rule out a varying
stellar mass-to-light ratio.

21472,Dopants Promoting Ferroelectricity in Hafnia: Insights From A Comprehensive Chemical Space Exploration,"  Although dopants have been extensively employed to promote ferroelectricity
in hafnia films, their role in stabilizing the responsible ferroelectric
non-equilibrium Pca21 phase is not well understood. In this work, using first
principles computations, we investigate the influence of nearly 40 dopants on
the phase stability in bulk hafnia to identify dopants that can favor formation
of the polar Pca21 phase. Although no dopant was found to stabilize this polar
phase as the ground state, suggesting that dopants alone cannot induce
ferroelectricity in hafnia, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Y and Gd were found to
significantly lower the energy of the polar phase with respect to the
equilibrium monoclinic phase. These results are consistent with the empirical
measurements of large remnant polarization in hafnia films doped with these
elements. Additionally, clear chemical trends of dopants with larger ionic
radii and lower electronegativity favoring the polar Pca21 phase in hafnia were
identified. For this polar phase, an additional bond between the dopant cation
and the 2nd nearest oxygen neighbor was identified as the root-cause of these
trends. Further, trivalent dopants (Y, La, and Gd) were revealed to stabilize
the polar Pca21 phase at lower strains when compared to divalent dopants (Sr
and Ba). Based on these insights, we predict that the lanthanide series metals,
the lower half of alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr and Ba) and Y as the most
suitable dopants to promote ferroelectricity in hafnia.
